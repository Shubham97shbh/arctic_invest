            a barrier layer disposed adjacent to the substrate, the barrier layer famed of
            <br/>
            a first
            <br/>
            polymeric material; and
            <br/>
            one or more wells for holding PCR samples, the one or more wells formed of a
            <br/>
            second polymeric material sealed to the barrier layer,
            <br/>
            wherein the substrate provides a PCR ramp rate of at least 5°C/second.
            <br/>
            2.    The microplate of Claim 1, wherein the microplate is configured to heat
            <br/>
            samples
            <br/>
            upon the flow of electric current through the substrate.
            <br/>
            3.    The microplate of Claim 1, wherein the substrate is configured to be
            <br/>
            separated
            <br/>
            from PCR samples by 10 micrometers or less.

            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
            <br/>
            [002]    In many fields specimen carriers in the form of support sheets, which
            <br/>
            may
            <br/>
            have a multiplicity of wells or impressed sample sites, are used for various
            <br/>
            processes
            <br/>
            where small samples are heated or thermally cycled. A particular example is
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            Polymerase Chain Reaction method (often referred to as PCR) for replicating
            <br/>
            DNA
            <br/>
            samples. Such samples require rapid and accurate thermal cycling, and are
            <br/>
            typically
            <br/>
            placed in a multi-well block and cycled between several selected temperatures
            <br/>
            in a pre-
            <br/>
            set repeated cycle. It is important that the temperature of the whole of the
            <br/>
            sheet or more
            <br/>
            particularly the temperature in each well be as uniform as possible.
            <br/>
            [003]    The samples may be liquid solutions, typically between 1 micro-1 and
            <br/>
            200
            <br/>
            micro-1 in volume, contained within individual sample tubes or arrays of
            <br/>
            sample tubes
            <br/>
            that may be part of a monolithic plate. The temperature differentials that may
            <br/>
            be
            <br/>
            measured within a liquid sample increase with increasing rate of change of
            <br/>
            temperature
            <br/>
            and may limit the maximum rate of change of temperature that may be
            <br/>
            practically
            <br/>
            employed.

            2
            <br/>
            [004]    Previous methods of heating such specimen carriers have involved the
            <br/>
            use of
            <br/>
            attached heating devices or the use of indirect methods where separately
            <br/>
            heated fluids are
            <br/>
            directed into or around the carrier.
            <br/>
            [005]    The previous methods of heating suffer from the disadvantage that
            <br/>
            heat is
            <br/>
            generated in a heater that is separate from the specimen carrier that is
            <br/>
            required to be
            <br/>
            heated. Such heating systems and methods suffer from heat losses accompanying
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            transfer of heat from the heater to a carrier sheet of the specimen carrier.
            <br/>
            In addition, the
            <br/>
            separation of the heater from the specimen carrier introduces a time delay or
            <br/>
            "lag" in the
            <br/>
            temperature control loop. Thus, the application of power to the heating
            <br/>
            elements does not
            <br/>
            produce an instantaneous or near instantaneous increase in the temperature of
            <br/>
            the block.
            <br/>
            The presence of a thermal gap or barrier between the heater and the block
            <br/>
            requires the
            <br/>
            heater to be hotter than the block if heat energy is to be transferred from
            <br/>
            the heater to the
            <br/>
            block. Therefore, there is a further difficulty that cessation of power
            <br/>
            application to the
            <br/>
            heater does not instantaneously stop the block from increasing in temperature.
            <br/>
            [006]    The lag in the temperature control loop will increase as the rate of
            <br/>
            temperature
            <br/>
            change of the block is increased. This may lead to inaccuracies in temperature
            <br/>
            control
            <br/>
            and limit the practical rates of change of temperature that may be used.
            <br/>
            Inaccuracies in
            <br/>
            terms of thermal uniformity and further lag may be produced when attached
            <br/>
            heating
            <br/>
            elements are used, as the elements are attached at particular locations on the
            <br/>
            block and
            <br/>
            the heat produced by the elements must be conducted from those particular
            <br/>
            locations to
            <br/>
            the bulk of the block. For heat transfer to occur from one part of the block
            <br/>
            to another, the
            <br/>
            first part of the block must be hotter than the other. Another problem with
            <br/>
            attaching a
            <br/>
            thermal element, particularly current Peltier effect devices, is that the
            <br/>

            <br/>
            the block and the thermal device will be subject to mechanical stresses due to
            <br/>
            differences
            <br/>
            in the thermal expansion coefficients of the materials involved. Thermal
            <br/>
            cycling will
            <br/>
            lead to cyclic stresses that will tend to compromise the reliability of the
            <br/>
            thermal element
            <br/>
            and the integrity of the thermal interface.

            SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
            <br/>
            [007]    An aspect of the invention provides a microplate for polymerase chain
            <br/>
            reaction ("PCR"), comprising a substrate comprising a metallic material for
            <br/>
            heating PCR
            <br/>
            samples and a barrier layer disposed adjacent to the substrate, the barrier
            <br/>
            layer formed of
            <br/>
            a first polymeric material. The microplate includes one or more wells for
            <br/>
            holding PCR
            <br/>
            samples, the one or more wells formed of a second polymeric material sealed to
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            barrier layer. The substrate provides a PCR ramp rate of at least 5 C/second
            <br/>
            ("s"). In an
            <br/>
            embodiment, the PCR ramp rate (or heating rate) is at least about 10 C/second.
            <br/>
            In
            <br/>
            another embodiment, the microplate is configured to heat samples upon the flow
            <br/>
            of
            <br/>
            electric current through the substrate. In another embodiment, the substrate
            <br/>
            is configured
            <br/>
            to be separated from PCR samples by 10 micrometers or less. In another
            <br/>
            embodiment,
            <br/>
            the second polymeric material is heat-sealed to the barrier layer. In another
            <br/>
            embodiment,
            <br/>
            the first polymeric material is chemically compatible with the second
            <br/>
            polymeric material.
            <br/>
            In another embodiment, the metallic material comprises an aluminum alloy. In
            <br/>
            another
            <br/>
            embodiment, the substrate is for generating heat upon the flow of electrical
            <br/>
            current
            <br/>
            through the substrate. In another embodiment, the substrate is for increasing
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            temperature of a sample in the one or more wells at a rate between about 5 C/s
            <br/>
            and
            <br/>
            15 C/s. In another embodiment, the metallic material has a resistivity between
            <br/>
            about
            <br/>
            2x10-8 ohm-m and 8x10-8 ohm-m. In another embodiment, the one or more wells
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <br/>
            comprise at least 24 wells. In another embodiment, the one or more wells
            <br/>
            comprise at
            <br/>
            least 96 wells.
            <br/>
            [008]    Another aspect of the invention provides a microplate for PCR,
            <br/>
            comprising a
            <br/>
            substrate comprising a metallic material for heating PCR samples, and a

            polymeric material.
            <br/>
            The microplate includes one or more wells formed of a second polymeric

            material sealed
            <br/>
            to the coating layer for containing PCR samples. The metal substrate provides
            <br/>
            well-to-

            comprising a
            <br/>
            substrate comprising a metallic material for heating PCR samples, and a
            <br/>
            coating layer
            <br/>
            disposed adjacent to the substrate, the coating layer formed of a first
            <br/>

            <br/>
            The microplate includes one or more wells for containing PCR samples, the one
            <br/>
            or more
            <br/>

            <br/>
            substrate
            <br/>
            provides a heating efficiency sufficient to allow for at least about 1 PCR
            <br/>
            cycle per
            <br/>
            minute, including fluorescence measurement for every cycle. In an embodiment,
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            substrate provides a heating efficiency sufficient to allow for at least about

            Microplates for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
            <br/>
            [0038]    An aspect of the invention provides a microplate for polymerase
            <br/>
            chain
            <br/>
            reaction (PCR). In embodiments, the microplate comprises a substrate including
            <br/>
            a
            <br/>
            metallic material for heating PCR samples and a barrier layer disposed over
            <br/>
            the substrate,
            <br/>
            the barrier layer formed of a first polymeric material. The microplate further
            <br/>
            includes
            <br/>
            one or more wells for containing PCR samples, the one or more wells formed of
            <br/>
            a second
            <br/>
            polymeric material sealed to the barrier layer. In some cases, the first
            <br/>
            polymeric material
            <br/>
            is different from the second polymeric material. In an example, the first
            <br/>
            polymeric
            <br/>
            material has a different glass transition temperature than the second
            <br/>
            polymeric material.
            <br/>
            In other cases, the first polymeric material is the same as the second
            <br/>
            polymeric material.
            <br/>
            In an example, the first polymeric material has the same or substantially the
            <br/>
            same glass
            <br/>
            transition temperature as the second polymeric material.
            <br/>
            [0039]    In some embodiments, the substrate provides a PCR ramp rate (or
            <br/>
            heating
            <br/>
            rate) of at least about 1 C/second, or 2 C/second, or 3 C/second, or 4

            The
            <br/>
            microplate of FIG. 1 has an assay 105 disposed in each of the wells.
            <br/>
            [0059]    In some cases, the moulding 102 can be formed from a single-piece

            another (such as by welding or with the aid of an adhesive).
            <br/>
            [0060]    With continued reference to FIG. 1, the wells 101 are at least
            <br/>
            partly defined by
            <br/>
            sidewalls of the moulding 102 at least partially formed of a polymeric

            metal plate
            <br/>
            103. This can provide for efficient thermal control in each of the wells.
            <br/>
            [0061]    In some embodiments, the moulding 102 can be secured to the metal

            FIG. 1.
            <br/>
            Heating in some cases is resistive heating. The rate of heating or cooling can
            <br/>
            be adjusted
            <br/>
            by varying the current passing through at least a portion of the microplate,
            <br/>
            or varying the
            <br/>
            electrical potential applied across the microplate.
            <br/>
            [0064]    In some embodiments, a disposable microplate (also "consumable"
            <br/>
            herein)
            <br/>
            may include a coated metal plate with a polymer moulding attached to the metal
            <br/>
            plate.
            <br/>
            The metal plate may be coated with a polymeric material that is compatible
            <br/>
            with the
            <br/>
            moulding. The polymer moulding may be formed of a polymeric material. The
            <br/>
            consumable may, in itself, be a heating element. The consumable may be
            <br/>
            directly heated
            <br/>
            by passing electrical current through the metal plate. The consumable may
            <br/>
            include liquid
            <br/>
            samples or assays that are in close contact with the plate, separated from the
            <br/>
            plate by a
            <br/>
            layer of polymer, such that heat transfer to and from the samples is fast and
            <br/>
            controllable.
            <br/>
            In some embodiments, the layer of polymer may have a thickness of about 10
            <br/>
            microns or
            <br/>
            other thickness provided herein (see above).
            <br/>
            [0065]    In some embodiments, the consumable may be heated by passing
            <br/>
            electrical
            <br/>
            current through the consumable along a number of different possible electric
            <br/>
            flow paths.
            <br/>
            In another embodiment, the contact fingers at the ends of the plate are
            <br/>
            connected to a
            <br/>
            system of bus bars. These bus bars are the single-turn secondary windings of
            <br/>
            four
            <br/>
            transformers. The consumable is configured to rest on (or come into electrical
            <br/>
            contact
            <br/>
            with) the bus bars. In some embodiments, the consumable is removable from the
            <br/>
            bus
            <br/>
            bars. In another embodiment, a fixed plate of similar geometry to the

            [0066]    In some embodiments, the low current primary drive to each
            <br/>
            transformer is
            <br/>
            proportionally controlled using phase-angle triggering of triac devices. Also,
            <br/>
            by using
            <br/>
            twin primary windings, the relative phase of the drive to each transformer can
            <br/>
            be

            embodiment,
            <br/>
            voltage applied to the plate is between about 0.1 V and 1 V, or between about
            <br/>
            0.25 V and
            <br/>

            another embodiment, the plate is clamped to gold-plated contacts on the bus
            <br/>
            bars using 6
            <br/>
            miniature hydraulic rams driven by a master cylinder actuated by an electric
            <br/>
            ball screw.
            <br/>
            The rams may each exert a force of about 2,000 Newtons (N), which produces
            <br/>
            sufficient
            <br/>
            deformation of the aluminum to disrupt the oxide film typically found on the

            [0069]    A microplate can include N rows by M columns of wells, wherein 'N'
            <br/>
            and 'M'
            <br/>
            are integers greater than zero. In some cases, N is at least 1, or 2, or 3, or
            <br/>
            4, or 5, or 6, or
            <br/>
            7, or 8, or 9, or 10, or 20, or more, and M is at least 1, or 2, or 3, or 4,

            <br/>
            8, or 9, or 10, or 20, or more. The rows can be orthogonal to the columns, or
            <br/>
            may be
            <br/>
            angularly disposed in relation to the columns at an angle greater than 00 and

            <br/>
            at an angle
            <br/>
            of about 45  in relation to the columns.
            <br/>
            [0070]    For example, a microplate can include 3 rows by 3 columns (3 X 3) of
            <br/>
            wells,
            <br/>
            or 9 total wells. As another example, a microplate can include 3 X 3, 4 X 6, 6
            <br/>
            X 4, 9 X 6
            <br/>
            or 6 X 9 wells. FIG. 10 shows a microplate 1000 having 6 rows by 9 columns of
            <br/>
            wells
            <br/>
            1001, or 54 total wells. The wells are formed of a polymeric material and are
            <br/>
            disposed
            <br/>
            adjacent to a substrate 1002 formed of a metallic material (e.g., aluminum).
            <br/>
            The
            <br/>
            substrate 1002 comprises a plurality of fingers (or finger-like projections)
            <br/>
            1003. Each
            <br/>
            finger 1003 has a top surface (facing the wells 1001) and a bottom surface.
            <br/>
            Atop surface
            <br/>
            of each of the fingers 1003 has a wave pattern that defines a crinkle on the
            <br/>
            top surface. A
            <br/>
            bottom surface (not shown) of each of the fingers 1003 can have a wave pattern
            <br/>
            defining
            <br/>
            a crinkle. At least a portion of the top and bottom surfaces of the fingers
            <br/>
            are configured
            <br/>
            to come in contact with bus bars for facilitating the flow of electrical
            <br/>
            current through the
            <br/>
            microplate 1000 during PCR.
            <br/>
            [0071]    In some embodiments, a crinkle has a corrugation between about 0.1
            <br/>
            micrometers ("microns") and 1 centimeter, or 1 micron and 10 millimeters
            <br/>
            ("mm"). In
            <br/>
            other embodiments, a crinkle has a corrugation of at least about 0.1 microns,
            <br/>
            or 1 micron,
            <br/>
            or 10 microns, or 100 microns, or 1 mm, or 10 mm, or 100 mm.
            <br/>
            [0072]    In some embodiments, a microplate includes a plurality of wells
            <br/>
            adjacent to a
            <br/>
            substrate. The substrate is formed of a metallic material, such as aluminum,
            <br/>
            and the
            <br/>
            plurality of wells are at least partly defined by a polymer matrix. In some
            <br/>
            cases, the
            <br/>
            polymer matrix defines each individual well. In other cases, the polymer
            <br/>
            matrix defines
            <br/>
            the one or more sidewalls of a well, but a bottom portion of a well is defined
            <br/>
            by the
            <br/>

            substrate. In some cases, the bottom portion of a well comprises a layer of a
            <br/>
            polymeric
            <br/>
            material adjacent to the substrate.
            <br/>
            [0073]    The microplate includes finger-like projections (see FIG. 10) for
            <br/>
            enabling the
            <br/>
            microplate to come in electrical communication with bus bars of a system for
            <br/>
            facilitating
            <br/>
            the flow of electrical current through the microplate. In some cases, a
            <br/>
            resistance between
            <br/>
            the microplate and the plurality of bus bars is minimized, and in some cases
            <br/>
            rendered
            <br/>
            ohmic, with the aid of wrinkles (or ridges) on surfaces of the finger-like
            <br/>
            projections
            <br/>
            configured to come in contact with the bus bars. The finger-like projections
            <br/>
            of the
            <br/>
            microplate can be tightly clamped to the bus bars.
            <br/>
            [0074]    In some cases, a microplate comprises fingers formed to have a wave
            <br/>
            pattern
            <br/>
            on their surfaces, thereby forming a crinkle. The crinkle can aid in removing
            <br/>
            any oxide
            <br/>
            layer formed on one or more surfaces of the fingers, which aids in improving
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            electrical contact between the fingers and the bus bars.
            <br/>
            [0075]    In some cases, a system for facilitating PCR can include a
            <br/>
            microplate, as
            <br/>
            described herein, and a temperature sensor for measuring the temperature in
            <br/>
            one or more
            <br/>
            zones of the microplate. The temperature sensor can be one or more
            <br/>
            thermocouples in
            <br/>
            electrical contact with the one or more zones. A thermocouple can be in
            <br/>
            electrical contact
            <br/>
            with a thermal zone. Alternatively, the temperature sensor can be an infrared
            <br/>
            sensor for
            <br/>
            measuring the temperature of one or more zones of the microplate. The infrared
            <br/>
            ("IR")
            <br/>
            sensor can be a non-contact IR sensor and configured to measure the
            <br/>
            temperature of a
            <br/>
            metallic substrate of the microplate.
            <br/>
            [0076]    The system can include at least 1, or 2, or 3, or 4, or 5, or 6, or
            <br/>
            7, or 8, or 9 , or
            <br/>
            10, or 15, or 20, or 30, or 40, or 50, or 100, or more sensors for measuring

            temperature of a microplate. The number of sensors used for temperature
            <br/>
            measurements
            <br/>
            can be equal to the number of thermal zones in the microplate. For example,
            <br/>
            the system
            <br/>
            can include nine sensors for measuring the temperature in each of nine thermal
            <br/>
            zones of a
            <br/>
            microplate.
            <br/>
            [0077]    A temperature sensor can provide continuous measurement of the
            <br/>
            temperature
            <br/>
            in a thermal zone of a microplate. In some cases this can provide for
            <br/>
            calibration to
            <br/>
            deliver a more accurate reading. Alternatively, a temperature sensor can
            <br/>
            provide
            <br/>
            intermittent temperature measurements, such as a temperature measurement at
            <br/>
            least every
            <br/>
            0.01 seconds, 0.1 seconds, 1 second, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 10
            <br/>
            minutes, 30
            <br/>
            minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day,
            <br/>
            2 days, or
            <br/>
            more. The sensors can provide feedback to determine how much heat is required
            <br/>
            for a
            <br/>
            particular zone of the plate.
            <br/>
            [0078]    In some embodiments, the temperature variation across a microplate
            <br/>
            is less
            <br/>
            than about 10 C, or 5 C, or 1 C, or 0.9 C, or 0.8 C, or 0.7 C, or 0.6 C, or
            <br/>
            0.5 C, or 0.4 C,
            <br/>
            or 0.3 C, or 0.2 C, or 0.1 C, or lower. This enables the definition of
            <br/>
            temperature (or
            <br/>
            thermal) zones for accurate thermal control in each zone.
            <br/>
            [0079]    Microplates provided herein are configured for heating to enable

            various
            <br/>
            transformer drive patterns for providing heat to the consumable. In some

            [0082]    In embodiments, the heating pattern of a consumable may be the
            <br/>
            product of a
            <br/>
            balance between heating rates and cooling rates of the consumable. That is, if
            <br/>
            the center
            <br/>
            of the consumable is cooled more rapidly that it is heated, a cooling effect

            will ensue. If

            the sides of the consumable are heated more rapidly than the center, the
            <br/>
            center will
            <br/>
            remain cooler relative to the sides of the consumable. In embodiments, heating
            <br/>
            rates and
            <br/>
            cooling may be dependent on various factors, such as, e.g., the modes of heat
            <br/>
            transfer
            <br/>
            (i.e., conductive, convective, or radiative) and the interplay between the
            <br/>
            modes; heat
            <br/>
            transfer coefficients; thermal mass; initial temperature; and PSU power.
            <br/>
            [0083]    With reference to FIGs. 2-5, the flow of current may produce a
            <br/>
            predetermined
            <br/>
            heating pattern. The use of different current paths through the metal plate
            <br/>
            may enable use
            <br/>
            of the consumable as plate heating zones for zonal control, enabling active
            <br/>
            control of
            <br/>
            thermal uniformity.
            <br/>
            [0084]    In some embodiments, the plate is cooled from below by means of high
            <br/>
            pressure air jets, such as 1 or more, or 2 or more, or 3 or more, or 4 or
            <br/>
            more, or 5 or more,
            <br/>
            or 10 or more high pressure air jets. The jets may be switched on and off
            <br/>
            individually,
            <br/>
            and air pressure may be controlled to give proportionality in cooling. This
            <br/>
            may
            <br/>
            effectively give zonal control over the applied cooling power. The heating
            <br/>
            system may
            <br/>
            also be used, even when cooling, to actively maintain overall thermal
            <br/>
            uniformity. In
            <br/>
            some embodiments, compressed air may be supplied from a building air supply,
            <br/>
            or a
            <br/>
            small local compressor, or by using 4 miniature air pumps with pulse-width

            and 50

            psi and the air is directed onto the bottom of the plate by nozzles, such as 4

            heating is induced upon the flow of an electrical current through the aluminum
            <br/>
            base of
            <br/>
            the plate. The connections between the plate and the rest of the circuit need
            <br/>
            to be low
            <br/>
            resistance when compared to the resistance of the plate so that the induced
            <br/>
            heating will
            <br/>
            not occur in the rest of the circuit. To achieve a low resistance the aluminum
            <br/>
            fingers (or
            <br/>
            finger-like projections) of the plate are tightly clamped on to high
            <br/>
            conductivity bus bars.
            <br/>
            Such clamping can provide ohmic contact between the fingers and the bus bars,
            <br/>
            which
            <br/>
            can provide for improved heating. In addition to the force required to tightly
            <br/>
            clamp the
            <br/>
            fingers, the fingers have been formed to have a wave pattern in their surface,
            <br/>
            a crinkle,
            <br/>
            such that as they are clamped flat there is a wiping action on the surface of
            <br/>
            the plate
            <br/>
            which breaks down any oxide or contamination that has coated them providing a
            <br/>
            good
            <br/>
            connection.
            <br/>
            [0086]    There are a number of elements to this arrangement, such as the
            <br/>
            provision of
            <br/>
            high force, &gt;100 Newtons on a repeatedly made connection. This is achieved by
            <br/>
            using an
            <br/>
            over center toggle type clamp; that clamp can have a built-in spring system
            <br/>
            which
            <br/>
            reduces the precision needed to set up the clamp. Other clamping methods may
            <br/>
            be used,
            <br/>
            such as hydraulic or screw clamping. Slight doming of the clamping ram
            <br/>
            provides an
            <br/>
            annular ring of contact, rather than a point or face contact which delivers
            <br/>
            both high
            <br/>
            contact force and preferable contact area to help provide repeatable low
            <br/>
            resistance
            <br/>
            connections. Putting undulations in the surface of the plate in the area of
            <br/>
            the clamp
            <br/>
            enables the material to move and wipe across clamping surfaces as it is
            <br/>
            crushed flat by
            <br/>
            the clamp ram. This process of wiping can used on various connectors to
            <br/>
            produce low
            <br/>
            resistance contacts. In some cases, the preform may be crushed. The size and

            depth of

            array
            <br/>
            of non-contact infra-red sensors to measure the temperature of the plate's
            <br/>
            aluminum base
            <br/>
            plate. There are 9 sensors in our current array which are used to measure the
            <br/>
            temperature
            <br/>
            in nine zones of the plate. These temperatures are used to control the heating
            <br/>
            system and
            <br/>
            produce the heating pattern desired. The infra-red sensors are industry
            <br/>
            standard parts but
            <br/>
            they only can measure as standard to an accuracy of about 1 degree. It is
            <br/>
            desirable to
            <br/>
            obtain times that accuracy of measurement; thus one embodiment individually
            <br/>
            calibrates
            <br/>
            each sensor across a range then uses this information to calculate an more
            <br/>
            accurate
            <br/>
            reading. This "calibration" of a sensor requires a number of points to be
            <br/>
            measured and
            <br/>
            these are used to populate an algorithm which extrapolates between them to
            <br/>
            give a value
            <br/>
            that is more accurate. This embodiment is advantageous based at least in part
            <br/>
            on the use
            <br/>
            of the "calibration" and the algorithm in combination to deliver a more

            resistive
            <br/>
            heating element which can be heated in a number of different ways to provide
            <br/>
            heat into
            <br/>
            multiple zones. The temperature of the zones is measured by an array of non-

            contact
            <br/>
            infra-red sensors which provide continuous measurement. Control of the system
            <br/>
            is
            <br/>
            complex because you can't heat just one zone without heating others both
            <br/>
            directly by
            <br/>
            flowing current through the zone and indirectly through heat transfer from
            <br/>
            neighbouring
            <br/>
            zones. An algorithm has been developed that provides this complex control
            <br/>
            using
            <br/>
            feedback from the thermal sensors to determine how much heat is required and

            embodiment, a system having software is provided for controlling heating and
            <br/>
            cooling of
            <br/>
            a plate and consumable in thermal communication with the plate. In another
            <br/>
            embodiment, a system is provided for maintaining thermal uniformity across an
            <br/>
            active
            <br/>
            region of the plate, whilst following a programmed temperature profile.
            <br/>
            [0093]    In some embodiments, when a user has filled the tubes on the plate
            <br/>
            with
            <br/>
            reagents, the tops of the tubes are sealed using a cover, such as a
            <br/>
            transparent sealing film.
            <br/>
            This may allow the measurement of fluorescence to be made from above the plate
            <br/>
            to
            <br/>
            follow the progress of PCR. A charge-coupled device (CCD) camera may be used
            <br/>
            to
            <br/>
            record fluorescent output. The CCD camera may have a filter wheel. Radiation
            <br/>
            for
            <br/>
            excitation may be provided by one or more excitation sources, such as light
            <br/>
            emitting
            <br/>
            diodes (LED's) with filters.
            <br/>
            [0094]    As an alternative, a microplate may be heated or cooled with the aid
            <br/>
            of a
            <br/>
            heating device employing Peltier heating. In some cases, the microplate of
            <br/>
            FIG. 1 may
            <br/>
            be used with the aid of a Peltier heating element in the vicinity of an
            <br/>
            underside of the
            <br/>
            microplate. In such a case, the metal plate may permit heat transfer to each
            <br/>
            of the wells
            <br/>
            (or chambers) of the microplate. In some cases, a microplate may be in thermal
            <br/>
            <br/>
            communication with a Peltier heating element, which may transfer heat from one
            <br/>
            side of
            <br/>
            the heating element to the other side of the heating element against a
            <br/>
            temperature gradient
            <br/>
            upon the consumption of electrical energy.

            [0096]    FIG. 8 shows a microplate 800 having a Peltier heating device 801
            <br/>
            below the
            <br/>
            microplate 800. The Peltier heating device 801 may include p-type 805 and n-
            <br/>
            type 810
            <br/>
            semiconducting (or "semiconductor") materials, and electrically conducting
            <br/>
            material 815
            <br/>
            connecting pairs of n-type and p-type semiconductors. The Peltier heating
            <br/>
            device 801
            <br/>
            may include a layer of a thermally insulating material over the n-type and p-

            <br/>
            semiconductors. The layer of thermally insulating material may be a ceramic
            <br/>
            material.
            <br/>
            The Peltier heating device 801 may provide heating or cooling to the
            <br/>
            microplate 800,
            <br/>
            including wells (or chambers) of the microplate 800. In some cases, the
            <br/>
            microplate 800
            <br/>
            may be heated with the aid of the Peltier heating device 801 in addition to
            <br/>
            passing a
            <br/>
            current through the microplate 800, as described above.
            <br/>
            [0097]    As another alternative, the microplate of FIG. 1 may be contacted on
            <br/>
            an
            <br/>
            underside of the microplate (e.g., adjacent to the metal plate of the
            <br/>
            microplate) with a
            <br/>
            resistive, radiative or convective heating device for providing heating (or
            <br/>
            cooling) to one
            <br/>
            or more wells of the microplate. In some cases, the microplate of FIG. 1 may
            <br/>
            be
            <br/>
            contacted on the underside with a clamp heating device. The clamp heating
            <br/>
            device may
            <br/>
            be used in conjunction with heating supplied with the aid of current directed
            <br/>
            through the

            [0098]    In some cases, heating devices provided herein may be used for both
            <br/>
            heating
            <br/>
            and cooling. For instance, the Peltier heating devices of FIGs. 7 and 8 may be
            <br/>
            used for
            <br/>

            Methods for forming microplates
            <br/>
            [0099]    Another aspect of the invention provides methods for forming
            <br/>
            microplates.
            <br/>
            Microplates provided herein can include substrates having one or more metals.
            <br/>
            In some
            <br/>
            embodiments, such substrates can include aluminum, aluminum oxide, an aluminum-
            <br/>
            <br/>
            containing alloy or composite material. In some cases, such substrates include
            <br/>
            <br/>
            aluminum. Current may be provided to substrates through electrodes in
            <br/>
            electrical contact
            <br/>
            with the substrates. In some cases, low or substantially low resistance
            <br/>
            electrical contacts
            <br/>
            may be provided to aluminum substrates for providing current to and through
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            aluminum substrates.
            <br/>
            [00100] In some cases, aluminum substrates may be in electrical communication
            <br/>
            with
            <br/>
            electrical contacts (or electrodes) at a junction resistance less than or
            <br/>
            equal to about 5 m-
            <br/>
            ohms, or 10 m-ohms, or 15 m-ohms, or 20 m-ohms, or 25 m-ohms, or 30 m-ohms, or
            <br/>
            35
            <br/>
            m-ohms, or 40 m-ohms, wherein 1 m-ohm is equal to 1x106 ohms. Such electrical
            <br/>
            contacts may have a low concentration of an aluminum-containing oxide, such as
            <br/>
            <br/>
            aluminum oxide, Al0x, wherein 'x' is a number greater than zero.
            <br/>
            [00101] In some cases, upon manufacturing a microplate having an aluminum
            <br/>
            substrate, corrugations may be pressed of formed in areas of the aluminum
            <br/>
            substrate for
            <br/>
            providing electrical contacts to the substrates. For instance, if six
            <br/>
            electrical contact areas
            <br/>
            are desired, each of the six electrical contact areas may corrugated prior to
            <br/>
            forming the
            <br/>
            <br/>
            CA 02821580 2013-06-13
            <br/>
            WO 2012/080746
            <br/>
            PCT/GB2011/052497
            <br/>
            34
            <br/>
            electrical contact areas. Such corrugation may break any aluminum oxide that
            <br/>
            may be
            <br/>
            formed on a surface of the aluminum substrate, thereby providing for low or
            <br/>
            substantially
            <br/>
            low resistance electrical contacts to the aluminum substrate.
            <br/>
            [00102] In some embodiments, one or more components of microplates are formed
            <br/>
            with the aid of a die or a plurality of dies. In some cases, microplates are
            <br/>
            formed by
            <br/>
            mechanical cold forming processing, such as forging (e.g., swaging). For
            <br/>
            instance, the
            <br/>
            metal plate of the microplate of FIG. 1 can be formed using mechanical cold
            <br/>
            forming
            <br/>
            processing. In cases in which the wells of a microplate are formed of a
            <br/>
            polymeric
            <br/>
            material, the wells can be formed using extrusion or injection molding.

            PCR systems
            <br/>
            [00103] Another aspect of the invention provides a system for sample
            <br/>
            processing,
            <br/>
            including heating for PCR. The system can include a controller with a central
            <br/>
            processing,
            <br/>
            memory (random-access memory and/or read-only memory), a data storage unit
            <br/>
            (e.g.,
            <br/>
            hard drive), a communications port (COM PORTS), and an input/output (1/0)
            <br/>
            module,
            <br/>
            such as an I/O interface. The processor may be a central processing unit (CPU)
            <br/>
            or a
            <br/>
            plurality of CPU's for parallel processing. The memory and/or data storage

            provided
            <br/>
            herein, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The system 900
            <br/>
            includes a
            <br/>
            processor 901, memory 902, input/output module 903, communications interface

            904 and
            <br/>
            data storage unit 905. The system 900 can be operatively coupled to a display
            <br/>
            906 for
            <br/>
            presenting a user interface 907 to a user operating the system 900. The user

            in some cases is a graphical user interface (GUI) having one or more textual,
            <br/>
            graphical,
            <br/>
            audio and video elements. The display 906 can be a touch screen, such as a
            <br/>
            capacitive
            <br/>
            touch or resistive touch screen. In some embodiments, the display 906 is
            <br/>
            disposed
            <br/>
            adjacent to the system 900. In other embodiments, the display 906 is disposed
            <br/>
            remotely
            <br/>
            from the system 900.
            <br/>
            [00105] The system 900 is operatively coupled to a PCR system 908 for
            <br/>
            performing
            <br/>
            PCR using microplates provided herein. The PCR system 908 can include sensors
            <br/>
            (e.g.,
            <br/>
            thermocouples) for enabling the system 900 to make temperature measurements
            <br/>
            during
            <br/>
            PCR with the aid of the PCR system 908.
            <br/>
            [00106] The memory 902 can be random-access memory (RAM) or read-only memory
            <br/>
            (ROM), to name a few examples, or a hard drive. The memory can include machine-
            <br/>
            <br/>
            readable code for implementing a method for performing PCR using the PCR
            <br/>
            system
            <br/>
            908. In some embodiments, the memory 902 includes machine-readable code for
            <br/>
            executing one or more temperature profiles, which can include temperature zone
            <br/>
            profiles
            <br/>
            as a function of time.
            <br/>
            [00107] In an example, a user inputs a PCR microplate having a sample into the
            <br/>
            PCR
            <br/>
            system 908. The PCR microplate can be as described herein. With the aid of the
            <br/>
            user
            <br/>
            interface 907 of the display, the user requests that the system 900 initiate
            <br/>
            sample
            <br/>
            processing and perform PCR on the sample. The system 900 executes code stored
            <br/>
            on the
            <br/>
            memory 902 to provide a programmed temperature profile (e.g., ramp rate) to

            [00109] Aspects of the systems and methods provided herein may be embodied in
            <br/>
            programming. Various aspects of the technology may be thought of as "products"
            <br/>
            or
            <br/>
            "articles of manufacture" typically in the form of executable code and/or
            <br/>
            associated data
            <br/>
            that is carried on or embodied in a type of machine-readable medium. "Storage"
            <br/>
            type
            <br/>
            media may include any or all of the tangible memory of the computers,
            <br/>
            processors or the
            <br/>
            like, or associated modules thereof, such as various semiconductor memories,
            <br/>
            tape drives,
            <br/>
            disk drives and the like, which may provide non-transitory storage at any time
            <br/>
            for the
            <br/>
            software programming. All or portions of the software may at times be
            <br/>
            communicated
            <br/>
            through the Internet or various other telecommunication networks. Such
            <br/>
            communications, for example, may enable loading of the software from one
            <br/>
            computer or
            <br/>
            processor into another, for example, from a management server or host computer
            <br/>
            into the
            <br/>
            computer platform of an application server or an intensity transform system.
            <br/>
            Thus,
            <br/>
            another type of media that may bear the software elements includes optical,
            <br/>
            electrical and
            <br/>
            electromagnetic waves, such as used across physical interfaces between local
            <br/>
            devices,
            <br/>
            through wired and optical landline networks and over various air-links. The
            <br/>
            physical
            <br/>
            elements that carry such waves, such as wired or wireless links, optical links
            <br/>
            or the like,
            <br/>
            also may be considered as media bearing the software. As used herein, unless
            <br/>
            restricted
            <br/>
            to non-transitory, tangible "storage" media, terms such as computer or machine
            <br/>
            "readable

            medium" refer to any medium that participates in providing instructions to a
            <br/>
            processor
            <br/>
            for execution.

            [00110] Hence, a machine-readable medium, such as computer-executable code,
            <br/>
            may
            <br/>
            take many forms, including but not limited to, a tangible storage medium, a
            <br/>
            carrier wave
            <br/>
            medium or physical transmission medium. Non-volatile storage media include,
            <br/>
            for
            <br/>
            example, optical or magnetic disks, such as any of the storage devices in any
            <br/>
            computer(s)
            <br/>
            or the like, such as may be used to implement the databases, etc. shown in the
            <br/>
            <br/>
            drawings. Volatile storage media include dynamic memory, such as main memory
            <br/>
            of
            <br/>
            such a computer platform. Tangible transmission media include coaxial cables;
            <br/>
            copper
            <br/>
            wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise a bus within a
            <br/>
            computer
            <br/>
            system. Carrier-wave transmission media may take the form of electric or
            <br/>
            electromagnetic signals, or acoustic or light waves such as those generated
            <br/>
            during radio
            <br/>
            frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-
            <br/>
            <br/>
            readable media therefore include for example: a floppy disk, a flexible disk,
            <br/>
            hard disk,
            <br/>
            magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD or DVD-ROM, any other
            <br/>
            optical medium, punch cards paper tape, any other physical storage medium with
            <br/>
            patterns
            <br/>
            of holes, a RAM, a ROM, a PROM and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory
            <br/>
            chip or cartridge, a carrier wave transporting data or instructions, cables or
            <br/>
            links
            <br/>
            transporting such a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer
            <br/>
            may read
            <br/>
            programming code and/or data. Many of these forms of computer readable media
            <br/>
            may be
            <br/>
            involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to a
            <br/>
            processor for
            <br/>
            execution.
            <br/>
            [00111] Another aspect of the invention provides a method for conducting PCR
            <br/>
            in
            <br/>
            which one or more of data from the reaction (e.g., fluorescence information,
            <br/>
            measured
            <br/>
            temperature), instructions for conducting PCR (e.g., ramp rate, predetermined

            temperature profile) and instructions for processing the data are located on a
            <br/>
            microplate,
            <br/>
            remotely or on a removable device. This can enable for plug-and-play PCR in
            <br/>
            which
            <br/>
            PCR can be performed across various platforms without the need for additional
            <br/>
            setup.
            <br/>
            [00112] In some cases, a removable device can be configured to interface with
            <br/>
            systems
            <br/>
            for conducting PCR, such as the system 900 of FIG. 9. In an example, the
            <br/>
            removable
            <br/>
            device is a universal serial bus (USB) drive (e.g., USB stick), or a removable
            <br/>
            memory
            <br/>
            disk (e.g., flash drive). In another example, the removable disk is a compact
            <br/>
            flash disk,
            <br/>
            or device configured to communicate with a serial advanced technology
            <br/>
            attachment
            <br/>
            interface (e.g., mini SATA, or M-SATA) or a personal computer memory card
            <br/>
            international association (PCMCIA, also PC card) interface.
            <br/>
            [00113] In some situations, both control and analysis instructions are
            <br/>
            provided on the
            <br/>
            removable device to allow a user to develop an experiment and analyze the
            <br/>
            results
            <br/>
            independently from a thermal cycler used for conducting the PCR reaction.
            <br/>
            Machine-
            <br/>
            readable instructions for implementing PCR can be located on the removable
            <br/>
            device. In
            <br/>
            some embodiments, the removable disk includes instructions and/or commands
            <br/>
            (e.g., as
            <br/>
            embodied in machine-readable code) that enable an identification of the type
            <br/>
            of hardware
            <br/>
            (or system, such as the system 900) interfacing with the removable device. The
            <br/>
            <br/>
            removable device can include processing instructions for performing PCR on the
            <br/>
            <br/>
            hardware. The processing instructions can be predetermined based on the type
            <br/>
            of system
            <br/>
            coupled to the removable device and/or the type of sample. The removable
            <br/>
            device can
            <br/>
            help identify the type of hardware it is plugged into and provide
            <br/>
            predetermined
            <br/>
            commands/interfaces to conduct PCR on that hardware directly without having to
            <br/>
            be
            <br/>
            installed on the hardware.

            [00114] Some embodiments provide a removable device and software located on a
            <br/>
            removable device that is configured to operate on various platforms. Test
            <br/>
            system
            <br/>
            software houses both control and analysis programs so that the user can
            <br/>
            develop the
            <br/>
            user's experiment and understand the results. Whilst operating on the machine
            <br/>
            itself it is
            <br/>
            also desirable that it will operate remotely to enable experimental design and
            <br/>
            results
            <br/>
            analysis to occur away from the test system. This software can reside on a
            <br/>
            removable
            <br/>
            device, such as a USB stick, other removable memory disks, such as, for
            <br/>
            example, a
            <br/>
            compact flash, M-SATA, or PCMCIA device.
            <br/>
            [00115] Such systems and devices provide various advantages. For example,
            <br/>
            having
            <br/>
            commands and/or instructions on a removable device can preclude the need for
            <br/>
            any
            <br/>
            additional installation. PCR can be conducted in such cases without the need
            <br/>
            for
            <br/>
            administrator privileges, and it be can performed on a machine without having
            <br/>
            to be
            <br/>
            installed on that machine. This provides a uniform platform for sample
            <br/>
            processing, as no
            <br/>
            hardware and/or software upgrades or installation may be required to setup a
            <br/>
            system (e.g.,
            <br/>
            system 900) for PCR on a particular sample. The removable media can store both
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            data files and the program so as to enable compatibility.
            <br/>
            [00116] PCR systems provided herein are configured for installation and
            <br/>
            operation on
            <br/>
            various software platforms, such as Windows-based (e.g., Windows 7) and Linux-
            <br/>
            based
            <br/>
            (e.g., Mac OS X) operating systems. Systems provided herein can be implemented
            <br/>
            on
            <br/>
            portable electronic devices, such as laptop computers, Smartphone (e.g., Apple

            iPhone0)
            <br/>
            and tablets (e.g., Apple iPad0). In some cases, such systems can communicate
            <br/>
            with
            <br/>
            peripheral devices for PCR, such as a heating system (e.g., current
            <br/>
            application device in
            <br/>
            communication with a microplate to define a circuit). This can provide for an

            for ready recognition across various platforms.
            <br/>
            [00117] PCR systems provided herein can be platform independent. In some
            <br/>
            situations, as long as the system can accept the removable memory device, then
            <br/>
            it would
            <br/>
            be able to run the software and conduct PCR. In some cases, all the
            <br/>
            information is stored
            <br/>
            on the removable device such that nothing is held on the platform that is
            <br/>
            running the
            <br/>
            software, which may reduce, if not eliminate, data security issues. The data
            <br/>
            and the
            <br/>
            application are transferred from the removable device, and the system provides
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            computing power and associated ancillary functions, such as a user interface
            <br/>
            and printing.
            <br/>
            [00118] Alternatively, PCR commands and/or instructions are stored a remote
            <br/>
            server
            <br/>
            (i.e., the "cloud") and accessed by the system (e.g., the system 900) through
            <br/>
            a network
            <br/>
            interface, such as a wired or wireless interface. A user can run PCR by
            <br/>
            providing a
            <br/>
            microplate, as described herein having a sample, and using the system to
            <br/>
            retrieve the
            <br/>
            requisite instructions for conducting PCR. Data gathered through the course of
            <br/>
            PCR can
            <br/>
            be stored on the system and subsequently uploaded to the remote server having
            <br/>
            a data
            <br/>
            storage unit.
            <br/>
            [00119] Alternatively, PCR commands and/or instructions are stored on a memory
            <br/>
            <br/>
            device that is integrated in a microplate. The microplate is configured to
            <br/>
            interface with a
            <br/>
            system for conducting PCR, such as the system 900 of FIG. 9. The system can
            <br/>
            include a
            <br/>
            reader for recognizing the memory device and subsequently preparing the system
            <br/>
            for
            <br/>
            sample processing. In some embodiments, the memory device is an electrically
            <br/>
            erasable
            <br/>
            programmable read-only memory (EEPROM).

            User interface
            <br/>
            [00120] Another aspect of the invention provides a user interface for enabling
            <br/>
            a user to

            setup a system for PCR, monitor PCR, and view PCR results. The user interface
            <br/>
            in some
            <br/>
            cases is a graphical user interface (GUI) having one or more textual,
            <br/>
            graphical, audio and
            <br/>
            video elements, such as menu elements for enabling a user to setup a PCR task,
            <br/>
            monitor
            <br/>
            the course of PCR, review results and conduct data analysis. The GUI can
            <br/>
            facilitate the
            <br/>
            implementation of PCR experiments. FIGs. 11-17 illustrate screenshots of a GUI
            <br/>
            that
            <br/>
            allows ready analysis and visualization of PCR results, as described herein.
            <br/>
            The GUI of
            <br/>
            FIGs. 11-17 can be implemented on systems provided herein, such as the system
            <br/>
            900 of
            <br/>
            FIG. 9, and presented to a user with the aid of a display, such as the display
            <br/>
            906 of FIG.
            <br/>
            9.
            <br/>
            [00121] FIG. 11 shows a GUI having various menu options, including "START A
            <br/>

            <br/>
            PCR
            <br/>
            of a sample in a microplate coupled to a system having the GUI. The user can
            <br/>
            select
            <br/>
            ANALYSIS to analyze PCR data. The menu options can be selected with the aid of
            <br/>
            a
            <br/>
            pointing device, such as a mouse or the user's finger in cases in which the
            <br/>
            GUI is
            <br/>
            displayed on a touch screen.
            <br/>
            [00122] In FIG. 12, the user has selected START A TEST and the system presents
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            user with sub-menu options, including TEMPLATES and HISTORY. The user can
            <br/>
            select
            <br/>
            TEMPLATES to access various test templates for performing PCR. Alternatively,
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            user can select HISTORY to review, for example, PCR history, such as what
            <br/>
            tests were
            <br/>
            conducted at a particular point in time. Such data can be stored in a data
            <br/>
            repository of the
            <br/>
            system. The user can select STANDARD TEST to proceed with setting up the
            <br/>
            system to
            <br/>
            conduct PCR.
            <br/>
            [00123] With reference to FIG. 13, under STANDARD TEST, the system presents
            <br/>
            the

            user with various PCR options, such requesting that the user select the type
            <br/>
            of PCR
            <br/>
            ("SELECT PCR TYPE"). The system presents the user with various PCR type
            <br/>
            options,
            <br/>
            including RICTOR, PKC, Rac, Rho, Akt and RHEB. The user can select a PCR type
            <br/>
            option. Next, with reference to FIG. 14, the system presents the user with
            <br/>
            various
            <br/>
            chemistry types ("CHEMISTRY TYPE"), such as ABI, Fast Advanced Master Mix and
            <br/>
            Gene Expression Master Mix. Next, with reference to FIG. 15, the system
            <br/>
            presents the
            <br/>
            user with tray settings ("TRAY SETTINGS") and enables the user to select genes
            <br/>
            of
            <br/>
            interest ("GENES OF INTEREST"), such as mTOR or RAPTOR. Next, with reference
            <br/>
            to FIG. 16, the system presents the user with thermal profile options,
            <br/>
            including start
            <br/>
            temperatures and target temperatures. The user can select from predetermined
            <br/>
            options, or
            <br/>
            manually input temperature settings. The system then presents the user with a
            <br/>
            confirmation screen, as shown in FIG. 17. The confirmation screen shows a
            <br/>
            temperature
            <br/>
            profile per cycle that the system will use in the PCR, the number of cycles
            <br/>
            ("REPEAT"),
            <br/>
            tray settings ("24 WELLS" has been selected in FIG. 17), among other settings.
            <br/>
            The
            <br/>
            temperature profile is a custom temperature profile, though predetermined
            <br/>
            settings may
            <br/>
            be used, if desired. The system provides the user the option to change the
            <br/>
            settings, or to
            <br/>
            proceed with conducting PCR ("RUN TEST").

            Example 1: coated metal plate
            <br/>
            [00124] Nominally 0.4 mm thick metal plates were produced from bulk processed
            <br/>
            material on a large scale where a metal ingot (e.g., 5 ton metal ingot) enters
            <br/>
            the process
            <br/>
            and is rolled and coated in a continuous operation. The material was an
            <br/>
            aluminum alloy
            <br/>
            rolled to a half-hard condition and then coated on one side (e.g., a top side)
            <br/>
            to a nominal
            <br/>
            thickness of about 10 microns with a polypropylene compatible material. This
            <br/>
            material
            <br/>
            <br/>

            allows polypropylene to be heat-sealed (or welded) to the metal plate, and
            <br/>
            does not
            <br/>
            inhibit the PCR. The other side (bottom) of the sheet was coated with an epoxy
            <br/>
            primer to
            <br/>
            a nominal thickness of 5 microns. This is present to normalize the infrared
            <br/>
            emissivity of
            <br/>
            the bottom side of the sheet. The material was slit into 160 mm wide strips
            <br/>
            and supplied
            <br/>
            in coiled form to an automatic stamping line where the individual plates are
            <br/>
            produced.
            <br/>
            The epoxy coating was then selectively removed from the contact fingers at the
            <br/>
            ends of
            <br/>
            the plates to allow electrical contact to be made.
            <br/>
            Example 2: polypropylene moulding
            <br/>
            [00125] To contain the liquid samples placed on the plate, a polypropylene
            <br/>
            moulding
            <br/>
            consisting of an array of vertical tube structures was welded to the metal
            <br/>
            plate of
            <br/>
            Example 1. The polypropylene moulding was formed of a plurality of tubes to
            <br/>
            define
            <br/>
            sample areas (or wells). The size and pattern of the tubes may be a matter of
            <br/>
            user choice;
            <br/>
            any pattern that fits within the actively temperature-controlled area in the
            <br/>
            middle of the
            <br/>
            plate may be used. Two familiar-looking options were selected: a 6 X 4 tube
            <br/>
            array on a 9
            <br/>
            mm pitch, and an 8 X 12 array on a 4.5 mm pitch. The whole assembly weighed
            <br/>
            10.5 g
            <br/>
            and was readily recyclable. Appropriately for a single-use item, the
            <br/>
            manufacturing cost
            <br/>
            of the consumable was low.
            <br/>
            [00126] While certain microplates have been describes as being consumable ore
            <br/>
            recyclable, it will be appreciated that in some cases such microplates need
            <br/>
            not be
            <br/>
            consumable or recyclable. In some embodiments, such microplates may be
            <br/>
            reusable,
            <br/>
            non-consumable, or non-recyclable.
