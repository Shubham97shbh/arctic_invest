            interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, re-inflammation, acute respiratory distress
            <br/>
            syndrome (ARDS), and sarcoidosis.
            <br/>
            4. The method of claim 2, wherein the subject is an alpha-1 antitrypsin
            <br/>
            deficiency subject.
            <br/>
            5. The method of claim 2, wherein the AAT is naturally occurring AAT
            <br/>
            purified from an unpurified mixture of proteins by a process comprising of
            <br/>
            chromatography on a plurality of ion exchange resins, comprising a first
            <br/>
            anion exchange resin followed by a cation and a second anion exchange
            <br/>
            resins.
            <br/>
            6. The method of claim 1, wherein the immune response is an anti-drug
            <br/>
            antibody (ADA) response.
            <br/>
            7. The method of claim 2, wherein the therapeutically effective amount of
            <br/>
            AAT is about 25 mg to about 250 mg AAT per day.
            <br/>
            8. The method of claim 2, wherein the therapeutically effective amount of the
            <br/>
            inhaled AAT is about 0.1 mg/kg/day to about 15 mg/kg/day.
            <br/>
            9. The method of claim 2, wherein the AAT is administered within a
            <br/>
            pharmaceutical composition.
            <br/>
            10. The method of claim 2, wherein the AAT administered by the inhalation
            <br/>
            route is aerosolized.
            <br/>

            METHODS OF INDUCING IMMUNE TOLERANCE AND REDUCING
            <br/>
            ANTI-DRUG ANTIBODY RESPONSE
            <br/>
            FIELD OF THE INVENTION
            <br/>
            The present invention relates to methods for suppressing or preventing an
            <br/>
            immune response to a specific antigen in a subject. The present invention
            <br/>
            further relates
            <br/>
            to administration of the specific antigen by the intravenous route followed by
            <br/>
            transition
            <br/>
            to an inhaled route to reduce an anti-drug antibody (ADA) response.
            <br/>
            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
            <br/>
            Immune responses are necessary for protection against potentially pathogenic
            <br/>
            microorganisms. However, undesired immune activation can cause injurious
            <br/>
            processes
            <br/>
            leading to damage or destruction of self tissue. Undesired immune activation
            <br/>
            occurs, for
            <br/>
            example, in autoimmune diseases where antibodies and/or T lymphocytes react
            <br/>
            with
            <br/>
            self-antigens to the detriment of the body. This is also the case for allergic
            <br/>
            reactions
            <br/>
            characterized by an exaggerated immune response to certain environmental
            <br/>
            materials,
            <br/>
            which may result in inflammatory responses leading to tissue destruction.
            <br/>
            Immune tolerance is the acquired lack of specific immune responsiveness to an
            <br/>
            antigen to which an immune response would normally occur. Typically, to induce
            <br/>
            <br/>
            tolerance, there must be exposure to a tolerizing antigen, which results in
            <br/>
            the death or
            <br/>
            functional inactivation of certain lymphocytes. This process generally
            <br/>
            accounts for
            <br/>
            tolerance to self-antigens, or self-tolerance. Immunosuppressive agents are
            <br/>
            useful in
            <br/>
            prevention or reduction of undesired immune responses. However,
            <br/>
            immunosuppressive
            <br/>
            agents can also cause systemic immune suppression, toxicity, and even death
            <br/>
            due to
            <br/>
            opportunistic infections.
            <br/>
            The induction of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) can result in adverse clinical
            <br/>
            responses such as hypersensitivity and autoimmunity, as well as altered
            <br/>
            pharmacokinetics (e.g., drug neutralization, abnormal biodistribution, and
            <br/>
            enhanced
            <br/>
            drug clearance rates). These clinical responses can alter the efficacy of the
            <br/>
            treatment.
            <br/>
            Therefore, immune responses caused by biopharmaceuticals can be an important
            <br/>
            safety
            <br/>
            and efficacy concern for regulatory agencies, drug manufacturers, clinicians,
            <br/>
            and
            <br/>
            patients.

            Accordingly, there is a need for safe and effective methods to decrease
            <br/>
            undesired
            <br/>
            immune responses and/or the probability of incidence of ADA to immunogenic

            therapeutic molecules, and to decrease antibody production when an undesired
            <br/>
            immune
            <br/>
            response occurs.

            DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
            <br/>
            The present invention discloses a method for suppressing or preventing an
            <br/>
            undesired immune response to a specific antigen in a subject.
            <br/>
            Definitions
            <br/>
            As used herein, the term "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin" (AAT) refers to a glycoprotein
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <br/>
            4
            <br/>
            that in nature is produced by the liver and lung epithelial cells and secreted
            <br/>
            into the
            <br/>
            circulatory system. AAT belongs to the Serine Proteinase Inhibitor (Serpin)
            <br/>
            family of
            <br/>
            proteolytic inhibitors. This glycoprotein consists of a single polypeptide
            <br/>
            chain
            <br/>
            containing one cysteine residue and 12-13% of the total molecular weight of
            <br/>
            carbohydrates. AAT has three N-glycosylation sites at asparagine residues 46,
            <br/>
            83, and
            <br/>
            247, which are occupied by mixtures of complex bi- and triantennary glycans.
            <br/>
            This
            <br/>
            gives rise to multiple AAT isoforms, having isoelectric points in the range of
            <br/>
            4.0 to 5Ø
            <br/>
            The glycan monosaccharides include N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, galactose,
            <br/>
            fucose,
            <br/>
            and sialic acid. AAT serves as a pseudo-substrate for elastase; elastase
            <br/>
            attacks the
            <br/>

            "alpha-1 Proteinase Inhibitor" (API). The term "glycoprotein" as used herein
            <br/>
            refers to a
            <br/>
            protein or peptide covalently linked to a carbohydrate. The carbohydrate may
            <br/>
            be
            <br/>
            monomeric or composed of oligosaccharides. It is to be explicitly understood
            <br/>
            that any
            <br/>
            AAT as is or will be known in the art, including plasma-derived AAT,

            As used herein "analog of alpha-l-antitrypsin" may mean a compound having
            <br/>
            alpha-l-antitrypsin-like activity. In one embodiment, an analog of alpha-l-
            <br/>
            antitrypsin is
            <br/>
            a functional derivative of alpha-l-antitrypsin. In a particular embodiment, an

            analog of
            <br/>
            alpha- 1-antitrypsin is a compound capable of significantly reducing serine
            <br/>
            protease
            <br/>
            activity. For example, an inhibitor of serine protease activity has the
            <br/>
            capability of
            <br/>
            inhibiting the proteolytic activity of trypsin, elastase, kallikrein,

            The term "antigen" broadly refers to a molecule that can be recognized by the
            <br/>
            immune system. It encompasses proteins, polypeptides, polysaccharides, small
            <br/>
            molecule haptens, and nucleic acids, as well as lipid-linked antigens
            <br/>
            (polypeptide- or

            The term "immunoglobulin" as used herein, includes any antigen binding protein
            <br/>
            <br/>
            comprising an immunoglobulin domain. Exemplary immunoglobulins are antibodies.

            chain
            <br/>
            immunoglobulins. Other "immunoglobulins" include T cell receptors.
            <br/>
            The term "antibody", as used herein, broadly refers to any immunoglobulin (Ig)
            <br/>
            <br/>
            molecule comprised of four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two

            variant, or
            <br/>
            derivative antibody formats are known in the art. N, non-limiting embodiments
            <br/>
            of

            which are discussed below.
            <br/>
            As used herein, immune tolerance (or simply "tolerance") is the process by
            <br/>
            which
            <br/>
            the immune system fails to attack an antigen. The non-responsiveness occurs in
            <br/>
            three
            <br/>
            forms: central tolerance, peripheral tolerance, and acquired tolerance.
            <br/>
            Tolerance can be
            <br/>
            either "natural" or "self-tolerance", where the body does not mount an immune
            <br/>
            response
            <br/>
            to self-antigens, or "induced tolerance", where tolerance to antigens can be
            <br/>
            generated by
            <br/>
            manipulating the immune system. When tolerance is induced, the body will not
            <br/>
            produce
            <br/>
            an immune response to the antigen. Mechanisms of tolerance and tolerance
            <br/>
            induction
            <br/>
            are complex and poorly understood. As is well known in the art (see, e.g.,

            presented, the
            <br/>
            type of antigen, and the involvement of T cells and other leukocytes in the
            <br/>

            With relation to delivery or exposure, "acute" refers to a relatively short
            <br/>
            duration.
            <br/>
            "Chronic" as used herein means lasting a long time, sometimes also meaning
            <br/>
            having a low intensity. With regard to delivery or exposure, "chronic" means

            for a
            <br/>
            prolonged period or long-term.
            <br/>
            As used herein, the terms "exacerbation" "exacerbation period" and
            <br/>
            "exacerbation
            <br/>
            episode" are used interchangeably to describe an increase in the severity of
            <br/>
            symptoms
            <br/>
            during a course of a disease, which is mostly associated with a worsening in
            <br/>
            the quality
            <br/>
            of life. Exacerbations are quite frequent in patients with chronic lung
            <br/>
            diseases in general
            <br/>
            and in AAT deficient patients in particular. By definition, exacerbations are
            <br/>
            a worsening
            <br/>
            and/or increase in the severity and/or magnitude of the pulmonary disease
            <br/>
            symptoms.

            indefinitely. Prevent
            <br/>
            also means reducing the risk of developing a disease, disorder, or condition.
            <br/>
            "Amelioration" or "ameliorate" or "ameliorating" refers to a lessening of at
            <br/>
            least
            <br/>
            one indicator, sign, or symptom of an associated disease, disorder, or
            <br/>
            condition. The
            <br/>
            severity of indicators may be determined by subjective or objective measures,

            <br/>
            "Fibrosis" refers to the formation of fibrous tissue. Excess fibrosis in an
            <br/>
            organ or
            <br/>
            tissue can lead to a thickening of the affected area and scar formation.
            <br/>
            Fibrosis can lead
            <br/>
            to organ or tissue damage and a decrease in the function of the organ or
            <br/>
            tissue. An
            <br/>
            example of fibrosis includes, but is not limited to, pulmonary fibrosis
            <br/>
            (fibrosis of the
            <br/>
            lung).
            <br/>
            As used herein, the terms "cystic fibrosis" or "CF" refer to an inherited
            <br/>
            autosomal
            <br/>
            recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic

            The term "emphysema," as is used herein, refers to a pathological condition of
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            lungs in which there is a decrease in respiratory function and often
            <br/>
            breathlessness due to
            <br/>
            an abnormal increase in the size of the air spaces, caused by an irreversible
            <br/>
            expansion of
            <br/>
            the alveoli and/or by the destruction of alveolar walls by neutrophil
            <br/>
            elastase.
            <br/>
            Emphysema is a pathological condition of the lungs marked by an abnormal
            <br/>
            increase in
            <br/>
            the size of the air spaces, resulting in strenuous breathing and an increased
            <br/>
            susceptibility
            <br/>
            to infection. It can be caused by irreversible expansion of the alveoli or by
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            destruction of alveolar walls. Due to the damage caused to lung tissue,
            <br/>
            elasticity of the
            <br/>
            tissue is lost, leading to trapped air in the air sacs and to impairment in
            <br/>
            the exchange of
            <br/>
            oxygen and carbon dioxide. In light of the breakdown of the alveolar walls,
            <br/>
            the airway
            <br/>
            support is lost, leading to obstruction in the airflow. Emphysema and chronic
            <br/>
            bronchitis
            <br/>
            frequently co-exist together to comprise chronic obstructive pulmonary
            <br/>
            disease.
            <br/>
            As used herein, the term "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease" abbreviated
            <br/>
            "COPD", refers to a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is
            <br/>
            not fully
            <br/>
            reversible. The airflow limitation is usually both progressive and associated

            increased
            <br/>
            sputum purulence. The severity of an exacerbation can be quantified by

            "Bronchiectasis," as used herein, refers to the abnormal and irreversible
            <br/>
            dilation
            <br/>
            of the proximal medium-sized bronchi (&gt;2 mm in diameter) caused by destruction

            of
            <br/>
            the muscular and elastic components of the bronchial walls. It can be
            <br/>
            congenital or
            <br/>
            acquired. Bronchiectasis can be caused by the bacteria Streptococcus
            <br/>
            pneumoniae,
            <br/>
            Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococus aureus, and
            <br/>
            Moraxella catarrhalis as well as the atypical pneumonias, Legionella
            <br/>
            pneumonia,

            <br/>
            arising
            <br/>
            from an allergy that is characterized by sudden recurring attacks of labored
            <br/>
            breathing,
            <br/>
            chest constriction, and coughing. In a typical asthmatic reaction, IgE
            <br/>
            antibodies
            <br/>
            predominantly attach to mast cells located in the lung interstitium in close
            <br/>
            association
            <br/>
            with the bronchioles and small bronchi. An antigen entering the airway will
            <br/>
            thus react
            <br/>
            with the mast cell-antibody complex, causing release of several substances,
            <br/>
            including,
            <br/>
            but not limited to interleukin cytokines, chemokines, and arachidonic acid-
            <br/>
            derived
            <br/>
            mediators, resulting in bronchoconstriction, airway hyperreactivity, excessive

            functional
            <br/>
            elements of the lung, including alveolar spaces and interstitial tissue.
            <br/>
            Generally,
            <br/>
            pneumonia can result from acute lung disease, lung inflammatory disease, or
            <br/>
            any
            <br/>
            perturbations in lung function due to factors such as inflammation or

            Preparation of AAT
            <br/>
            According to one aspect of the present invention a purified stable composition
            <br/>
            of
            <br/>
            AAT is provided. Preferably, a liquid composition of purified, stable AAT is

            International application WO 2005/027821, to the applicant of the present
            <br/>
            invention,
            <br/>
            provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a purified, stable, active AAT
            <br/>
            in a
            <br/>
            form of a ready to use sterile solution. WO 2005/027821 also provides process,
            <br/>
            which
            <br/>
            combines removal of contaminating substances (i.e., lipids, lipoproteins and
            <br/>
            other
            <br/>
            proteins), and separation of active from inactive AAT by sequential
            <br/>
            chromatography
            <br/>
            steps. The process disclosed in that invention is highly suitable for a large-
            <br/>
            scale
            <br/>
            production of AAT, in the range of tens of kilograms or more.
            <br/>
            The mixture of proteins from which the AAT is purified is preferably Cohn
            <br/>
            Fraction IV-
            <br/>
            1 paste, but can include other Cohn Fractions, separately or in combination;
            <br/>
            human
            <br/>
            blood plasma; plasma fractions; or any protein preparation containing AAT. For
            <br/>
            <br/>
            instance, the process is applicable to purification of recombinant human AAT
            <br/>
            from the
            <br/>
            milk of transgenic animals.

            11
            <br/>
            In that application, the mixture of proteins comprising AAT is dispersed in an
            <br/>
            <br/>
            aqueous medium, preferably water, at a ratio of about 13 to about 35 liters
            <br/>
            per about 1
            <br/>
            kg of source material, preferably Cohn Fraction IV-1 paste. The pH of the
            <br/>
            dispersion is
            <br/>
            adjusted to a pH range of from about 8.0 to about 9.5. The pH adjustment
            <br/>
            stabilizes the
            <br/>
            AAT and promotes the dissolution of the AAT in the dispersion, thereby
            <br/>
            increasing the
            <br/>
            production yield. Dispersion may take place at an elevated temperature of
            <br/>
            between 30 C
            <br/>
            and 40 C for further increase in AAT solubility.
            <br/>
            A particular advantage of that process is the elimination of contaminants or
            <br/>
            by-
            <br/>
            products that otherwise compromise the efficiency of AAT purification
            <br/>
            processes. In
            <br/>
            particular, Cohn Fraction IV-1 paste preparations contain a significant amount
            <br/>
            of the
            <br/>
            lipoprotein Apo A-1, which has the effect of compromising column flow and
            <br/>
            capacity
            <br/>
            during purification. Other non-desired proteins such as albumin and
            <br/>
            transferrin are also
            <br/>
            present in the paste preparation. Removing a portion of such contaminants

            according to
            <br/>
            invention disclosed in WO 2005/-27821 is performed by two steps: (a) removing
            <br/>
            contaminating lipids and lipoproteins by lipid removal agent and (b)
            <br/>
            precipitating a
            <br/>
            portion of contaminating protein from the AAT-containing aqueous dispersion.
            <br/>
            The
            <br/>
            removal of contaminating proteins, without loss of AAT, enables a significant
            <br/>
            reduction
            <br/>
            in equipment scale, e.g., column size.
            <br/>
            The precipitate that forms can be separated by conventional means such as
            <br/>
            centrifugation or filtration, and is then discarded. The supernatant is ready
            <br/>
            for further
            <br/>
            purification, for example an anion exchange resin. The AAT is then eluted from
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            column. The solution is treated to reduce its water content and change the
            <br/>
            ionic
            <br/>
            composition by conventional means such as by diafiltration, ultrafiltration,
            <br/>
            lyophilization, etc., or combinations thereof.
            <br/>
            According to one embodiment, the AAT-containing effluent obtained after the
            <br/>
            first anion exchange chromatography is concentrated by ultrafiltration. The
            <br/>
            retentate is
            <br/>
            then diafiltered against pure water to reach conductivity within the range of
            <br/>
            from about
            <br/>
            3.5 to about 4.5 mS/cm.
            <br/>
            To further purify the AAT-containing solution obtained after the first anion
            <br/>
            exchange chromatography, the solution is loaded on a cation exchange resin
            <br/>
            with the
            <br/>
            same type of buffer used for the anion-exchange step, having appropriate pH
            <br/>
            and
            <br/>
            conductivity to allow the AAT to pass and be washed off with the buffer flow
            <br/>
            through,
            <br/>
            <br/>
            CA 03085696 2020-06-12

            WO 2019/116367
            <br/>
            PCT/IL2018/051342
            <br/>
            12
            <br/>
            while contaminating substances are retained on the cation exchange resin.
            <br/>
            The AAT-containing solution obtained after the cation exchange chromatography
            <br/>
            can
            <br/>
            be treated to reduce its water content. According to one embodiment, the
            <br/>
            solution is
            <br/>
            concentrated by ultrafiltration.
            <br/>
            The ion-exchange chromatography is also used to separate active AAT from
            <br/>
            inactive AAT. That invention further comprises methods for separating active
            <br/>
            AAT
            <br/>
            from other contaminating substances, including solvent/detergent compounds
            <br/>
            used for
            <br/>
            viral inactivation. Such separation is achieved by the second anion exchange
            <br/>
            chromatography. The AAT eluted from the second anion exchange chromatography
            <br/>
            step is therefore not only highly active, but also highly pure.
            <br/>
            Throughout the process of that invention only one type of buffer is used, with
            <br/>
            <br/>
            adjustment of pH and conductivity as required throughout the various process
            <br/>
            steps.
            <br/>
            According to one embodiment, the buffer is any suitable acid/salt combination
            <br/>
            that
            <br/>
            provides acceptable buffer capacity in ranges of pH required throughout the
            <br/>
            process.
            <br/>
            According to preferred embodiments the process uses a buffer other than
            <br/>
            citrate-based
            <br/>
            buffer. According to yet other embodiments, the buffer anion is acetate.
            <br/>
            According to one embodiment, the process of that invention further comprises
            <br/>
            viral
            <br/>
            removal and/or viral inactivation steps. Methods for viral removal and
            <br/>
            inactivation are
            <br/>
            known in the art.
            <br/>
            One method for viral removal is filtration, preferably nanofiltration,
            <br/>
            removing
            <br/>
            both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. According to one embodiment, the
            <br/>
            viral
            <br/>
            removal step comprises filtration. According to another embodiment, the virus
            <br/>
            removal
            <br/>
            step is performed after the cation exchange chromatography. Typically, the
            <br/>
            cation
            <br/>
            exchange flow-through solution containing AAT is concentrated, and then
            <br/>
            nanofiltered.
            <br/>
            According to one embodiment, the method of viral inactivation employed
            <br/>
            comprises a
            <br/>
            solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment. The viral inactivation step is preferably
            <br/>
            performed
            <br/>
            prior to loading the solution on the second anion exchange resin. According to
            <br/>
            one
            <br/>
            embodiment, the detergent used is polysorbate and the solvent is Tri-n-Butyl-
            <br/>
            Phosphate
            <br/>
            (TnBP). According to another embodiment, the polysorbate is polysorbate 80.
            <br/>
            According to one embodiment Polysorbate 80 may be added from about 0.8% to
            <br/>
            about
            <br/>
            1.3% volume per weight (v/w) of the resulting mixture and TnBP may be added
            <br/>
            from
            <br/>
            about 0.2% to about 0.4% weight per weight of the resulting mixture.
            <br/>
            The solution containing active, purified AAT obtained after the second anion

            chromatography can be further processed to obtain a pharmaceutical composition
            <br/>
            for
            <br/>
            therapeutic, diagnostic, or other uses. To prepare the product for therapeutic
            <br/>
            <br/>
            administration the process further comprises the steps of changing the ionic
            <br/>
            composition of the solution containing purified, active AAT to contain a
            <br/>
            physiologically
            <br/>
            compatible ion and sterilizing the resulted solution.
            <br/>
            The purified AAT obtained by the process of that invention is highly stable.
            <br/>
            According to one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises at least
            <br/>
            90%
            <br/>
            pure, preferably 95% pure, more preferably 99% pure AAT. According to another
            <br/>
            embodiment, at least 90% of the AAT is in its active form.
            <br/>
            According to some embodiments, highly dispersible dry powder compositions are
            <br/>
            used, comprising high concentration of active alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) and
            <br/>
            specific
            <br/>
            excipients, suitable for pulmonary delivery of AAT. The dry powder
            <br/>
            compositions
            <br/>
            disclosed herein comprise, according to some embodiments, AAT molecules in
            <br/>
            their
            <br/>
            monomeric form, having low aggregation level. The AAT dry powder compositions
            <br/>
            exhibit an exceptional stability and low aggregation properties, and thus are
            <br/>
            highly
            <br/>
            suitable for use with inhalation devices as well as in other dry-powder dosage
            <br/>
            forms.

            Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Treatment
            <br/>
            The term "pharmaceutical composition" is intended to be used herein in its
            <br/>
            broader sense to include preparations containing a protein composition in
            <br/>
            accordance
            <br/>
            with this invention used for therapeutic purposes. The pharmaceutical
            <br/>
            composition
            <br/>
            intended for therapeutic use should contain a therapeutic amount of AAT, i.e.,
            <br/>
            that
            <br/>
            amount necessary for preventative or curative health measures.
            <br/>
            As used herein, the term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an
            <br/>
            amount of
            <br/>
            a protein or protein formulation or composition which is effective to treat a
            <br/>
            condition in
            <br/>
            a living organism to which it is administered over some period of time.
            <br/>
            Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured by
            <br/>
            processes well known in the art, e.g. by means of conventional mixing,
            <br/>
            dissolving,
            <br/>
            granulating, grinding, pulverizing, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying,
            <br/>
            encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilizing processes.
            <br/>
            Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention
            <br/>
            thus may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more acceptable
            <br/>
            diluents
            <br/>
            or carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries, which facilitate processing

            active compounds into preparations, which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper
            <br/>
            <br/>
            formulation is dependent on the route of administration chosen. According to
            <br/>
            certain
            <br/>
            currently preferred embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the
            <br/>
            present
            <br/>
            invention are formulated in a form suitable for inhalation.
            <br/>
            The AAT-containing pharmaceutical compositions disclosed in WO 2005/027821
            <br/>
            to the Applicant of the present invention are advantageous over hitherto known
            <br/>
            AAT-
            <br/>
            containing preparations, as the AAT is highly stable also when the composition
            <br/>
            is kept
            <br/>
            in a liquid form. Therefore, it is not necessary to lyophilize the AAT
            <br/>
            preparation for
            <br/>
            stable storage in a form of a powder. Subsequently, there is no need to
            <br/>
            reinstate the
            <br/>
            powder to a liquid before use for parenteral administration or for inhalation.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            According to certain currently preferred embodiments, AAT in a ready-to-use
            <br/>
            liquid
            <br/>
            formulation is used with the methods of the present invention.
            <br/>
            It has been estimated that only 2% of the intravenously administered AAT dose
            <br/>
            reaches
            <br/>
            the lung (Hubbard and Crystal, 1990. Lung 168 Supp1:565-78, 1990). This is a
            <br/>
            major
            <br/>
            disadvantage in treating pulmonary diseases in general, and in treating
            <br/>
            exacerbation
            <br/>
            episodes in particular.
            <br/>
            Therefore, administration of AAT by the inhalation route is more beneficent as
            <br/>
            it
            <br/>
            enriches the lower respiratory tract to higher levels than by IV
            <br/>
            administration of AAT.
            <br/>
            The inhalation route also requires lower therapeutic doses of AAT and thus the
            <br/>
            scarce
            <br/>
            supply of human plasma-derived AAT, currently being the only source for AAT,
            <br/>
            would
            <br/>
            be available for the treatment of more patients. This route of administration
            <br/>
            may be also
            <br/>
            more effective in neutralizing neutrophil elastase, and in correcting the
            <br/>
            imbalance
            <br/>
            between proteinase and anti-proteinases in the lung tissues, and is thus
            <br/>
            highly suitable
            <br/>
            for treating pulmonary diseases at periods of exacerbation. In addition,
            <br/>
            administration
            <br/>
            by inhalation is simpler and less stressful for the patient than the
            <br/>
            intravenous route and
            <br/>
            would reduce the burden on the local health care system (by requiring less
            <br/>
            clinical
            <br/>
            input).

            <br/>
            For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,655,379 discloses methods and devices for
            <br/>
            delivering an
            <br/>
            active agent formulation to the lung of a human patient. The active agent
            <br/>
            formulation
            <br/>
            may be in dry powder form, it may be nebulized, or it may be in admixture with

            a
            <br/>
            propellant. According to the teaching of that patent, the active agent

            formulation,
            <br/>
            particularly insulin, is delivered to a patient at an inspiratory flow rate of

            Methods regarding the delivery of AAT formulations using nebulizers are
            <br/>
            discussed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,093,316, 5,618,786 and 5,780,440.

            The Applicant of the present invention and co-workers disclosed the use of
            <br/>
            eFlow
            <br/>
            nebulizer, disclosed in International Patent Application WO 01/34232, for AAT

            delivery to the lung. The eFlow nebulizer provides an increased amount of
            <br/>
            aerosol
            <br/>
            during inhalation while minimizing both aerosol losses during exhalation and
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            residual drug in the nebulizer reservoir. The nebulizer includes an aerosol
            <br/>
            generator that
            <br/>
            atomizes the liquid through a vibrating diaphragm into particle sizes that are
            <br/>
            efficiently
            <br/>
            delivered to the lungs.
            <br/>
            The operating conditions for delivery of a suitable inhalation dose will vary
            <br/>
            according to the type of mechanical device employed. For some aerosol delivery

            systems, such as nebulizers, the frequency of administration and operating
            <br/>
            period will
            <br/>
            be dictated chiefly by the amount of the active composition (AAT according to
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            present invention) per unit volume in the aerosol. Typically, the higher the
            <br/>
            concentration of the protein in the nebulizer solution the shorter is the
            <br/>
            operating period.
            <br/>
            Some devices such as metered dose inhalers may produce higher aerosol
            <br/>
            concentrations
            <br/>
            than others and thus will be operated for shorter periods to give the desired
            <br/>
            result.
            <br/>
            According to certain embodiments, the methods of the present invention employ
            <br/>
            a
            <br/>
            nebulizer comprising a ready-to-use inhalation solution comprising
            <br/>
            therapeutically
            <br/>
            effective amount of AAT.
            <br/>
            According to certain embodiments, the ready-to-use liquid pharmaceutical
            <br/>
            composition is packed in pre-sterilized unit dose vials containing 0.25 m1-10
            <br/>
            ml,
            <br/>
            preferably 0.25 ml to 5 ml, commonly used for ready to use inhalation
            <br/>
            solutions. The
            <br/>
            vial can be made of glass or polymeric materials or the liquid can be filled
            <br/>
            into
            <br/>
            polyethylene or any other suitable polymer vials, manufactured for instance by
            <br/>
            a blow
            <br/>
            fill seal process.
            <br/>
            According to other embodiments, at least 60% of the nebulized dose is
            <br/>
            dissolved
            <br/>
            in droplets having a diameter of 5 p.m or less. Such droplet size enhances the
            <br/>
            AAT
            <br/>
            delivery to the alveolar regions, where its activity is mostly required.
            <br/>
            According to
            <br/>
            certain embodiments, at least 50%, preferably 60% and more preferably 70% or
            <br/>
            more of
            <br/>
            the loaded nominal dose of AAT can be delivered to the subject.
            <br/>
            According to the teaching of the present invention, AAT is administered at the
            <br/>
            early
            <br/>
            stages of various pulmonary diseases. As described hereinabove, the pulmonary
            <br/>
            disease
            <br/>
            may be associated with an inherited deficiency in AAT. In such cases, patients
            <br/>
            typically
            <br/>
            receive intravenous augmentation therapy of AAT. Thus, according to certain
            <br/>
            embodiments, the method of the present invention comprises administering to a
            <br/>
            subject
            <br/>
            in need thereof a therapeutic amount of AAT intravenously followed by
            <br/>
            administering
            <br/>
            AAT via inhalation.
            <br/>
            Typically, the inhaled AAT is administered for relatively short periods of
            <br/>
            time.
            <br/>
            According to certain embodiments, the inhalation time is between about 5-15
            <br/>
            minutes,
            <br/>
            preferably about 10 minutes. The AAT may be administered once a week or
            <br/>
            administration can be repeated at least twice a week, each day or even twice a
            <br/>
            day.
            <br/>
            The AAT protein is an acute phase reactant protein and, as such, its synthesis

            <br/>
            on the levels of AAT and other analytes in epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and

            36 subjects with documented alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency were enrolled into
            <br/>
            two dose groups of 80 mg/day and 160 mg/day. Each group was randomized per

            <br/>
            (Glassia ), which contains the same formulation as AAT for inhalation, is

            previous IV
            <br/>
            exposure. It was noted that subjects who were treated by IV administered AAT
            <br/>
            up to 8
            <br/>
            weeks prior to the beginning of the study and then were treated with inhaled

            AAT (total
            <br/>
            of 10 patients) had a significantly lower risk of mounting an ADA response
            <br/>
            than
            <br/>
            subjects who were AAT-Naive. There were 8 former IV treated subjects in the
            <br/>
            AAT
            <br/>
            treatment arms, none of whom developed an antibody response during the double

            <br/>
            <br/>
            (OLE), did not develop an ADA response during the OLE. Only one subject did

            Example 2: Tolerance induction to inhaled AAT by pre-exposure to IV injections
            <br/>
            <br/>
            of AAT
            <br/>
            The principle of the test is induction of tolerance to inhaled AAT by pre-
            <br/>
            exposure of mice to AAT administered by the IV route. The IV route may be non-
            <br/>
            immunogenic and may allow tolerance induction to the protein of interest.
            <br/>
            The hAAT lung-specific transgenic mice (C57BL/6 background, from Prof. Eli
            <br/>
            Lewis laboratory) express minute amounts of hAAT and are tolerized to hAAT.
            <br/>
            The
            <br/>
            animals therefore represent a good model to study the effect of different
            <br/>
            routes of
            <br/>
            administration of AAT and the induction of tolerance to inhaled human AAT by
            <br/>
            IV
            <br/>
            injection.
            <br/>
            Two groups of 10 mice each were used in the study.
            <br/>
            Group 1 received an IV injection of hAAT 2% at a dose of 60 mg/kg weight once
            <br/>
            weekly for four weeks, followed by inhalation of hAAT 2% at a dose of 13 i.t.g
            <br/>
            once
            <br/>
            weekly for four weeks.
            <br/>
            Group 2, as a control group, received saline instead of AAT during the IV
            <br/>
            treatment and
            <br/>
            the same inhalation treatment as group 1.

            respectively)
            <br/>
            Blood samples from mice were drawn before the first IV treatment, before the
            <br/>
            first inhalation, and at the end of the 4th week of inhalation. BAL samples
            <br/>
            were
            <br/>
            collected from all mice at the end of the 4th week of inhalation. Samples were
            <br/>
            tested for
            <br/>
            ADA levels (Anti-hAAT antibodies). Lungs were collected for histology.
            <br/>
            The determination of anti-AAT ADA in the BAL and sera of mice will be
            <br/>
            conducted at CRL laboratories. CRL have developed an ADA detection test based
            <br/>
            on
            <br/>
            affinity purification of AAT. Thus the ADA detection test is not dependent on
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            source of the antibodies and can be applied to mice for determination of the
            <br/>
            murine IgG
            <br/>
            level.
