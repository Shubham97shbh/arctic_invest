            METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR TRACKING HEALTH IN ANIMAL POPULATIONS
            <br/>
            TECHNICAL FIELD
            <br/>
            [0002] The present invention generally relates to animal health tracking, and,
            <br/>
            in
            <br/>
            particular, to the tracking of physiological and/or behavioral parameters of
            <br/>
            multiple
            <br/>
            animals in an animal population.
            <br/>
            BACKGROUND
            <br/>
            [0003]    Identifying and treating illness in early stages of livestock
            <br/>
            development can
            <br/>
            aid in reducing herd disease outbreak, and reduce herd loss and the need for
            <br/>
            culling.
            <br/>
            There are a variety of illnesses from which confined cattle commonly suffer.
            <br/>
            Diseases of the respiratory system are a major cause of illness and death in
            <br/>
            cattle.
            <br/>
            One such illness includes Bovine Respiratory Disease Complex (BRD), which
            <br/>
            often
            <br/>
            turns into severe and/or fatal bacterial pneumonia. It is further noted that
            <br/>
            major
            <br/>
            viruses such as Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), parainfluenza virus,
            <br/>
            syncytial virus, and bovine virus are often a precursor to BRD. Antibiotics
            <br/>
            are often
            <br/>
            not effective, especially when treated in later stages of the illness. As
            <br/>
            such, early
            <br/>
            detection of the disease is critical in minimizing herd loss. Currently, the
            <br/>
            most
            <br/>
            common identification of sickness is via rectal temperature and visual cues,
            <br/>
            which
            <br/>
            often occur well beyond early onset of symptoms, such as fever, of the given
            <br/>
            illness.
            <br/>
            As such, it would be advantageous to provide a system and method that provides
            <br/>
            <br/>
            illness identification and/or diagnosis that cures the deficiencies of prior
            <br/>
            approaches
            <br/>
            identified above.

            one or
            <br/>
            more tag assemblies 102a-102d. It is noted herein that the terms
            <br/>
            "concentrator" is
            <br/>
            used interchangeably with "receiver" and/or "base station" throughout the
            <br/>
            present
            <br/>
            disclosure.
            <br/>
            [0017] In another embodiment, the concentrator 104 is also communicatively
            <br/>
            coupled to a controller 108 via a network 106. For example, the controller 108

            <br/>
            [0021] Referring now to FIG. 1B, in one embodiment, one or more of the tag
            <br/>
            assemblies 102 includes one or more sensors 114. The one or more sensors 114
            <br/>
            may include any sensor known in the art capable of measuring one or more
            <br/>
            physiological and/or behavioral characteristics of an animal. For example, the
            <br/>
            one or
            <br/>
            more sensors 114 may include, but are not limited to, a temperature probe
            <br/>
            (e.g., IR
            <br/>
            temperature sensor, thermocouple, thermistor and the like), a heart rate
            <br/>
            monitor
            <br/>
            (e.g., optical heart monitor), an accelerometer, a magnetometer, a gyroscope,

            <br/>
            one or
            <br/>
            more sensors 114 may be configured to monitor a wide range of physiological
            <br/>
            and/or
            <br/>
            behavioral characteristics including, but not limited to, the frequency and/or
            <br/>
            duration
            <br/>
            of chewing, a range of motion (e.g. range of head motion), body movements,
            <br/>
            posture, the amount of activity (e.g., number of steps or distance traveled in

            [0037] Referring now to FIG. 1C, in one embodiment, a tag assembly 102
            <br/>
            includes
            <br/>
            multiple sensors 114. For example, the tag assembly 102 may include, but is
            <br/>
            not
            <br/>
            limited to, a first sensor 114a, a second sensor 114b and up to and including
            <br/>
            an Nth
            <br/>
            sensor 114c.    In this regard, sensors 114a-114c may include any two or more
            <br/>
            sensors known in the art capable of measuring one or more physiological and/or
            <br/>
            <br/>
            behavioral characteristics of an animal. For example, the two or more sensors
            <br/>
            114s1-114c may include, but are not limited to, two or more of the following:
            <br/>
            a
            <br/>
            temperature probe, a heart rate monitor, an accelerometer, a magnetometer, a
            <br/>
            gyroscope, an inertial measurement unit, a location sensor or the like.

            WO 2017/096256                                            PCT/US2016/064761
            <br/>
            [0038] In one embodiment, the one or more sensors 114 of the tag assembly 102
            <br/>
            may measure one or more physiological characteristics. For example, one or
            <br/>
            more
            <br/>
            sensors 114 may include a thermal probe (e.g., thermocouple) for measuring the
            <br/>
            <br/>
            temperature of an animal with which the given tag assembly 102 is disposed. In
            <br/>
            this
            <br/>
            regard, temperature data of given animal may be measured and tracked as a
            <br/>
            function of time. By way of another example, one or more sensors 114 may
            <br/>
            include
            <br/>
            a heart monitor for measuring the heart rate of an animal with which the given
            <br/>
            tag
            <br/>
            assembly 102 is disposed. In this regard, heart rate data of given animal may
            <br/>
            be
            <br/>
            measured and tracked as a function of time.
            <br/>
            [0039] In another embodiment, the system 100 may measure one or more
            <br/>
            behavioral characteristics. In one embodiment, the one or more behavioral
            <br/>
            characteristics measured by the one or more sensors 114 of the tag assemblies
            <br/>
            102
            <br/>
            may include, but are not limited, one or more animal posture characteristics.
            <br/>
            In one
            <br/>
            embodiment, an animal posture characteristic may include, but is not limited
            <br/>
            to, head
            <br/>
            tilt, body lean, gait or the like. For example, head tilt may be determined
            <br/>
            for a given
            <br/>
            animal by measuring the relative position (e.g., height of head relative to an
            <br/>
            initial
            <br/>
            head position) associated with a given tag assembly 102 in order to deduce the
            <br/>
            <br/>
            height of the animal's head, and, thus, the tilt of the animals head and/or
            <br/>
            neck. The
            <br/>
            head tilt measurement may consist of a relative head tilt measurement. For
            <br/>
            example,
            <br/>
            the relative head tilt measurement may include comparing a measured head tilt
            <br/>
            value to one or more head tilt values (or statistically aggregated head title
            <br/>
            values
            <br/>
            (e.g., average)) of a portion of the animal population. By way of another
            <br/>
            example,
            <br/>
            the relative head tilt measurement may include comparing a measured head tilt
            <br/>
            value to initial head tilt value (or a time-averaged value) of the same
            <br/>
            animal. By way
            <br/>
            of another example, the one or more sensors 114 of a given tag assembly 102
            <br/>
            may
            <br/>
            include an accelerometer, magnetometer and/or gyroscope (or a consolidated
            <br/>
            IMU)
            <br/>
            suitable for measuring the head tilt of a given animal.
            <br/>
            [0040] In another embodiment, the one or more behavioral characteristics
            <br/>
            measured by the one or more sensors 114 of the tag assemblies 102 may include,
            <br/>
            <br/>
            but are not limited, one or more position (or movement) characteristics of one
            <br/>
            or
            <br/>
            more animals. In one embodiment, the one or more position (or movement)
            <br/>
            characteristics may include, but are not limited to, the number of steps taken
            <br/>
            by the
            <br/>
            14

            <br/>
            animal over a selected time period. For example, at least one of the sensors
            <br/>
            114 on-
            <br/>
            board the tag assembly 102 associated with a given animal may include an
            <br/>
            accelerometer, such as a three-axis accelerometer, configured to measure
            <br/>
            motion
            <br/>
            data associated with the given animal. By way of another example, the sensors
            <br/>
            114
            <br/>
            may be configured as a motion sensor (e.g., nine-axis motion sensor) equipped
            <br/>
            with
            <br/>
            an accelerometer, gyroscope and/or magnetometer (or consolidated IMU).
            <br/>
            [0041] In another embodiment, once the motion data is collected by the one or
            <br/>
            more tag assemblies 102, the processor and programming instructions of the
            <br/>
            concentrator 104 or the controller 108 may convert this motion data to "animal
            <br/>
            steps"
            <br/>
            based on a pre-programmed algorithm, which relates motion data to steps. In
            <br/>
            another embodiment, the motion data captured by the one or more sensors 114
            <br/>
            may
            <br/>
            be converted to the distance traveled by an animal over a selected time period
            <br/>
            or
            <br/>
            average speed of the animal over a selected time period. In another
            <br/>
            embodiment, as
            <br/>
            noted previously herein, one or more sensors 114 of the tag assembly 102 of a
            <br/>
            given
            <br/>
            animal may include a GPS chip 118. In this regard, a GSP-enabled tag assembly
            <br/>
            102 may be used to directly measure the location and movement of a given
            <br/>
            animal
            <br/>
            of an animal heard.
            <br/>
            [0042] In another embodiment, once the one or more tag assemblies 102 of the
            <br/>
            system 100 collect physiological data and/or behavioral data associated with
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            respective animals, the one or more tag assemblies 102 may transmit all or
            <br/>
            some of
            <br/>
            this data to the concentrators 104. In turn, the concentrator 104 may transmit
            <br/>
            all or
            <br/>
            some of the received physiological data and/or behavior data to controller 108
            <br/>
            (or
            <br/>
            another controller) for analysis, as described throughout the present
            <br/>
            disclosure.
            <br/>
            [0043] Referring now to FIG. 1D, in one embodiment, the tag assembly 102
            <br/>
            includes one or more temperature sensors, such as, but not limited to, a first
            <br/>
            <br/>
            temperature sensor 114a and a second temperature sensor 114b. In another
            <br/>
            embodiment, the tag assembly 102 includes an inertial measurement unit (IMU)
            <br/>
            122c for monitoring orientation, direction, tilt and/or movement of the tag
            <br/>
            assembly
            <br/>
            102.    For example, the IMU 122c may include, but is not limited to, an
            <br/>
            accelerometer, a magnetometer, and a gyroscope.

            <br/>
            [0044] It is noted herein that a temperature sensor, such as the first
            <br/>
            temperature
            <br/>
            sensor 114a and/or the second temperature sensor 114a, may include any
            <br/>
            temperature sensor known in the art. For example, the first temperature sensor
            <br/>
            114a and/or the second temperature sensor 114b may include, but are not
            <br/>
            limited to,
            <br/>
            a thermopile detector, an infrared sensor, or a resistive temperature device.
            <br/>
            It is
            <br/>
            further noted that a first temperature sensor 114a and/or a second temperature
            <br/>
            <br/>
            sensor 114b may detect multiple temperatures simultaneously, such as, but not
            <br/>
            limited to, the temperature of a proximate object (e.g. a portion of an ear)
            <br/>
            and the
            <br/>
            ambient temperature. In one embodiment, two temperature sensors 114a and 114b
            <br/>
            may measure a differential temperature between a proximate object (e.g., ear
            <br/>
            canal)
            <br/>
            and the ambient environment. In another embodiment, multiple temperature
            <br/>
            sensors
            <br/>
            are configured to measure multiple differential temperatures between multiple
            <br/>
            locations of an animal and the ambient environment.
            <br/>
            [0045] In another embodiment, each of two temperature sensors 114a and 114b
            <br/>
            may simultaneously measure two temperatures such that the tag assembly 102, as
            <br/>
            a
            <br/>
            whole, simultaneously measures four temperatures. FIG. lE illustrates a
            <br/>
            simplified
            <br/>
            schematic view of tag assembly 102 equipped with two temperature probes 114a,
            <br/>
            114b and disposed within the ear of an animal. In one embodiment, a tag 102 is
            <br/>
            <br/>
            positioned in the ear 142 of an animal (e.g. a cow) such that first
            <br/>
            temperature sensor
            <br/>
            114a simultaneously measures a first temperature and a second temperature,
            <br/>
            while
            <br/>
            a second temperature sensor 114b simultaneously measures a third temperature
            <br/>
            and a fourth temperature. In one embodiment, the first temperature includes a
            <br/>
            temperature of a portion of the inner ear 1444, which may be referred to as an
            <br/>
            inner
            <br/>
            ear temperature (IET). The second temperature includes an ambient temperature
            <br/>
            of
            <br/>
            the ear canal, which may be referred to as an Ambient Temperature Near Canal
            <br/>
            (ANC). The third temperature includes a temperature of a portion of the ear
            <br/>
            surface
            <br/>
            146, which may be referred to as an Ear Surface Temperature (EST). The fourth
            <br/>
            temperature includes an ambient temperature near a printed circuit board (PCB)
            <br/>
            <br/>
            associated with the tag 102. The fourth temperature may be referred to as an
            <br/>
            Ambient Temperature near PCB Surface (APCB). It is noted herein that ambient
            <br/>
            temperatures (e.g. the second and fourth temperatures) may be used to
            <br/>
            calibrate the
            <br/>
            IET and EST temperature measurements. It is further noted that at extreme
            <br/>
            temperatures, such as high or low temperatures, the IET and EST temperatures
            <br/>
            may

            <br/>
            have offsets that may introduce errors when analyzed using a data analysis
            <br/>
            algorithm. By way of example, an offset associated with the IET and/or the EST
            <br/>
            may
            <br/>
            cause a data analysis algorithm to issue a false warning. By way of another
            <br/>
            example, an offset associated with the IET and/or the EST may cause a data
            <br/>
            analysis algorithm to not issue a warning when a warning is appropriate. It is
            <br/>
            noted
            <br/>
            herein that ambient temperature measurements (e.g. the ANC and/or the APCB)
            <br/>
            may be used to adjust the IET and/or EST temperatures to generate an adjusted
            <br/>
            temperature, which serves to compensate for environmental circumstances and
            <br/>
            aids
            <br/>
            in reducing or eliminating the frequency of false positives or missed
            <br/>
            temperature
            <br/>
            deviations. By way of example, an adjusted temperature may be calculated using
            <br/>
            <br/>
            the equation:
            <br/>
            Adjusted Temp = A x IET + B x EST + C x (ANC + APCB)
            <br/>
            where A, B, and C are weighting constants. In some embodiments, the value of
            <br/>
            weighting constant A is greater than the value of weighting constant B. In
            <br/>

            embodiments, the values of one or more of the weighting constants A, B, or C
            <br/>
            may
            <br/>
            be acquired from a calibration table. For example, the IET may provide the
            <br/>
            basis
            <br/>
            function for the temperature estimate and may be weighted highest in the above
            <br/>
            <br/>
            equation. Further, the EST component may be weighted slightly below the IET.
            <br/>
            In
            <br/>
            addition, both ANC and APCB may be used to calibrate the IET and EST

            (e.g.
            <br/>
            a buzzer) to facilitate the location of a tag assembly 102. By way of another
            <br/>
            example, an indicator may include one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs)
            <br/>
            configured to visually display the status of an animal via the state of the
            <br/>

            not limited to, a feed source (e.g., grain), a water source, a mineral source

            [0048] In one embodiment, one or more concentrators 104 may be placed
            <br/>
            proximate to the nutrient source 158. The system 100 may monitor one or more

            concentrator
            <br/>
            104 (or concentrators). In this regard, the system 100 may measure and/or
            <br/>
            track a
            <br/>
            position characteristic between one or more animals 152-156 and the nutrient

            (or
            <br/>
            concentrators) and the nutrient source 158. In one embodiment, the system 100
            <br/>
            may measure and/or track the position characteristic between the tag assembly

            and the concentrator 104 using an RF signal, transmitted from the

            of the
            <br/>
            concentrator 104. For example, one or more program instructions may be used to
            <br/>
            <br/>
            determine a given position characteristic, such as distance, proximity (e.g.,
            <br/>
            proximity
            <br/>
            to nutrient source 158), position (e.g., position in feed lot), signal
            <br/>
            direction and the
            <br/>
            like, between the communication circuitry 120 of a given tag assembly 102 and

            the
            <br/>
            communication circuitry 123 of the concentrator 104 based on one or more
            <br/>
            characteristics of a signal (e.g., signal 154a, 154b or 154c) as measured by
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            concentrator 104.
            <br/>
            [0049] In one embodiment, a distance of one or more animals 152-156 from the
            <br/>
            nutrient source 158 may be deduced by measuring signal strength of the RF
            <br/>
            signal
            <br/>
            (e.g., signal 154a, 154b, or 154c) emanating from one or more tag assemblies
            <br/>
            102.
            <br/>
            For example, as shown in FIG. 1C, a distance d1 of a first animal 152 from the
            <br/>
            <br/>
            nutrient source 158 may be deduced by measuring a signal strength of the RF
            <br/>
            signal
            <br/>
            154a emanating from the tag assembly 102 associated with the first animal 152.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Further, a distance d2 of a second animal 154 from the nutrient source 158 may
            <br/>
            be
            <br/>
            deduced by measuring signal strength of the RF signal 154b emanating from the
            <br/>
            tag
            <br/>
            assembly 102 associated with the second animal 154. In addition, a distance d3
            <br/>
            of a
            <br/>
            third animal 156 from the nutrient source 158 may be deduced by measuring
            <br/>
            signal
            <br/>

            WO 2017/096256                                            PCT/US2016/064761
            <br/>
            strength of the RF signal 154c emanating from the tag assembly 102 associated
            <br/>
            with
            <br/>
            the third animal 156. In this manner, the distance away from the nutrient
            <br/>
            source 158
            <br/>
            may be deduced for N number of animals in the given animal population 150.
            <br/>
            [0050] Further, the frequency with which the one or more animals 152-156
            <br/>
            utilize
            <br/>
            the nutrient source 158 may be determined through monitoring the distance of
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            one or more animals 1 52-1 56 from the nutrient source 158 as a function of
            <br/>
            time. In
            <br/>
            addition, the use of multiple concentrators 104, each positioned at different
            <br/>
            nutrient
            <br/>
            sources 158, may allow the system 100 to monitor feeding frequency, watering
            <br/>
            frequency and the like for the one or more animals 152-156.
            <br/>
            [0051] FIG. 1H illustrates the implementation of multiple concentrators 104a-
            <br/>
            104d
            <br/>
            and a set of tag assemblies 102 disposed on animals 152, 154, 156 in a given
            <br/>
            animal population 150, in accordance with one embodiment of the present
            <br/>
            disclosure. In one embodiment, the concentrators 104a-104e may be positioned
            <br/>
            about a given feeding area or a region where the animals reside (e.g.,
            <br/>
            feedlot). For
            <br/>
            example, multiple concentrators 104a-104e, each equipped with an antenna
            <br/>
            (e.g.,
            <br/>
            omnidirectional or directional antenna), may be distributed about a given
            <br/>
            feedlot (in
            <br/>
            the case of cattle). In this regard, signal strength associated with a
            <br/>
            particular tag
            <br/>
            assembly 102 may be measured by multiple concentrators (e.g., concentrators
            <br/>
            104a,
            <br/>
            104b, 104c, 104d and/or 104e), each at different known locations. It is noted
            <br/>
            that the
            <br/>
            relative positions between the concentrator is known and can be easily
            <br/>
            measured.
            <br/>
            Such a configuration allows for a determination (or estimation) of position of
            <br/>
            a
            <br/>
            particular tag assembly 102 through a position algorithm, which estimates
            <br/>
            position
            <br/>
            based on the signal strength of the particular tag assembly at two or more of
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            concentrators 104a-104e and the known positions of the concentrators 104a-
            <br/>
            104e.
            <br/>
            For example, a radio triangulation procedure may be used to estimate the
            <br/>
            position of
            <br/>
            a tag assembly based on the interaction of the tag assembly 102 with three or
            <br/>
            more
            <br/>
            concentrators 104a-104e.    FIG. 11 illustrates a conceptual view 160 of the
            <br/>
            determination of location of a given tag assembly 102 based on such a radio
            <br/>
            triangulation procedure.
            <br/>
            [0052] In another embodiment, one or more concentrators 104 may be equipped
            <br/>
            with a directional antenna. In this regard, the distance and direction of one
            <br/>
            or more
            <br/>
            animals 152-156 may be determined. Such a configuration may allow for a single

            concentrator
            <br/>
            104 to monitor feeding frequency, watering frequency and the like for the one

            or

            more animals 152-156. In another embodiment, multiple concentrators 104 may be
            <br/>
            <br/>
            equipped with a directional antenna. Based on the direction of signal

            detection of a
            <br/>
            given tag assembly 102 by two or more concentrators, the system 100 may
            <br/>
            determine an approximate position of the tag assembly 102 (e.g., location at
            <br/>
            which
            <br/>
            the directional vectors intersect). FIG. 1J illustrates a conceptual view 170
            <br/>
            of the
            <br/>
            determination of location of a given tag assembly 102 using two or more
            <br/>
            concentrators 104a, 104b equipped with a direction antenna. As shown in FIG.
            <br/>
            1J,
            <br/>
            the approximate position of the particular tag assembly corresponds to the
            <br/>
            position
            <br/>
            where the direction vector between the first concentrator 104a and the tag

            assembly
            <br/>
            102 intersects with the direction vector between the second concentrator 104b
            <br/>
            and
            <br/>
            the tag assembly 102.
            <br/>
            [0053] It is further noted herein that the system 100 may include multiple
            <br/>
            concentrators 104, where each concentrator is coupled to a different set of
            <br/>
            tag
            <br/>
            assemblies 102. In one embodiment, a first concentrator 104 is coupled to a
            <br/>
            first set
            <br/>
            of tag assemblies 102. In another embodiment, a second concentrator 104 is
            <br/>
            coupled to a second set of tag assemblies 102. It is further noted herein that
            <br/>
            a

            concentrator 104 may be coupled to one or more tag assemblies 102 according to
            <br/>
            <br/>
            any network topology known in the art including, but not limited to, star and

            to
            <br/>
            the concentrator 104 via point-to-point connections. In another embodiment,

            one or

            more repeaters (not shown) are placed between a concentrator 104 and one or

            given

            [0055] In another embodiment, in the context of the signal strength based
            <br/>
            techniques described above, the distance traveled and/or the average speed of
            <br/>
            a
            <br/>
            given animal may be measured by tracking the position data of a given tag
            <br/>
            assembly
            <br/>
            102 as function of time.
            <br/>
            [0056] In another embodiment, as previously noted, the concentrator 104 may
            <br/>
            transmit all or some of the received physiological and/or behavioral data to
            <br/>
            controller
            <br/>
            108 (or another controller). For example, the concentrator 104 may transmit
            <br/>
            all or
            <br/>
            some of the received physiological and/or behavioral data to controller 108
            <br/>
            (or
            <br/>
            another controller) via network 106. In one embodiment, once received by the
            <br/>
            controller 108, the program instructions of the controller 108 may determine a
            <br/>
            health
            <br/>
            state of the one or more animals based on the physiological data (e.g.,
            <br/>
            temperature,
            <br/>
            heart rate and etc.) and/or behavioral data (e.g., head tilt, feeding
            <br/>
            frequency, amount
            <br/>
            of movement (e.g., steps) and etc.). For example, upon collecting one or more
            <br/>
            physiological and/or behavioral characteristics, the one or more concentrators
            <br/>
            104
            <br/>
            may transmit (e.g., wirelessly or wireline) the collected information to
            <br/>
            controller 108
            <br/>
            (or another controller) via a network (e.g., internet, intranet and the like).
            <br/>
            In another
            <br/>
            embodiment, the one or more processors 130 of the controller 108, via a set of
            <br/>
            <br/>
            program instructions (e.g., maintained in memory 132), may carry out a number
            <br/>
            of
            <br/>
            data processing steps on the data to determine a health state of one or more
            <br/>
            animals of the animal population.
            <br/>
            [0057] In one embodiment, the measured animal characteristics are compared to
            <br/>
            a
            <br/>
            known standard set of characteristics. For example, a database (not shown) may
            <br/>
            be
            <br/>
            maintained in memory 132 of the controller 108 (or any other memory accessible
            <br/>
            by
            <br/>
            the controller 108) and structured to relate one or more animal
            <br/>
            characteristics to a
            <br/>
            particular health state. For instance, any one or more of the physiological
            <br/>
            characteristics and/or behavioral characteristics may be correlated to known
            <br/>
            health
            <br/>
            states of studied animals. After a series of trial-and-error measurements are
            <br/>
            performed, the database may be constructed and stored in memory 132. In one
            <br/>
            embodiment, the database may correlate a single characteristic to a particular
            <br/>
            health
            <br/>
            state. For example, the controller 108 may utilize the stored database to
            <br/>
            correlate
            <br/>
            head tilt to the health state of an animal. For instance, a head tilt above a
            <br/>
            certain
            <br/>
            angle may be associated with a "healthy" animal, while head tilt below a
            <br/>
            certain
            <br/>
            21
            <br/>
            <br/>
            CA 03007296 2018-06-01
            <br/>
            WO 2017/096256                                            PCT/US2016/064761
            <br/>
            angle may be associated with an "unhealthy" animal. Further, the average time
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            head tilt is above/below a particular threshold may be used to determine the
            <br/>
            health
            <br/>
            state of the animal. It is recognized that any of the measured characteristics
            <br/>
            <br/>
            described previously herein may be utilized in a single variable context to
            <br/>
            determine
            <br/>
            the health state of an animal. In this regard, the controller 108 may identify
            <br/>
            an
            <br/>
            unhealthy animal, or a potentially unhealthy animal. In the event of an
            <br/>
            unhealthy, or
            <br/>
            a potentially unhealthy, the animal is identified and the controller 108 may
            <br/>
            notify a
            <br/>
            user via user devices 112a or 112b that the animal is unhealthy or potentially
            <br/>
            <br/>
            unhealthy.
            <br/>
            [0058] In another embodiment, the database may correlate multiple
            <br/>
            characteristics
            <br/>
            to a particular health state. For example, the controller 108 may utilize the
            <br/>
            stored
            <br/>
            database to correlate multiple physiological and/or behavior characteristics
            <br/>
            to a
            <br/>
            particular health state of an animal. In this regard, the database may reflect
            <br/>
            a multi-
            <br/>
            variable relationship between the health state of an animal and two or more
            <br/>
            physiological and/or behavior characteristics. For example, the multi-variable
            <br/>
            <br/>
            database may be constructed to relate the health state of one or more animals
            <br/>
            to two
            <br/>
            or more of temperature, heart rate, head tilt, feeding frequency, amount of
            <br/>
            movement
            <br/>
            (e.g., steps) and etc. For instance, a first head tilt value, a first
            <br/>
            temperature value
            <br/>
            and a first feeding frequency value may be associated with a "healthy" animal,
            <br/>
            while
            <br/>
            a second head tilt value, a second temperature value and a second feeding
            <br/>
            frequency value may be associated with an "unhealthy" animal. It is recognized
            <br/>
            that
            <br/>
            any of the measured characteristics described previously herein may be
            <br/>
            utilized in a
            <br/>
            multi-variable context to determine the health state of an animal. Again, in
            <br/>
            the event
            <br/>
            an unhealthy, or a potentially unhealthy, animal is identified, the controller
            <br/>
            108 may
            <br/>
            notify a user via user devices 112a or 112b that the animal is unhealthy or
            <br/>
            potentially
            <br/>
            unhealthy.
            <br/>
            [0059] In another embodiment, an unhealthy animal is identified via a
            <br/>
            differential
            <br/>
            comparison of measured characteristics for a first animal to measured
            <br/>
            characteristics
            <br/>
            associated with one or more other members of the animal population. For
            <br/>
            example,
            <br/>
            one or more measured physiological and/or behavior characteristics for a first
            <br/>
            animal
            <br/>
            may be compared to one or more measured physiological and/or behavior
            <br/>
            characteristics for at least a second animal or an average of two or more
            <br/>
            animals. In
            <br/>
            22
            <br/>
            <br/>
            CA 03007296 2018-06-01
            <br/>
            WO 2017/096256                                            PCT/US2016/064761
            <br/>
            this regard, outlier characteristics displayed by a given animal may be
            <br/>
            identified by
            <br/>
            directly comparing the measured characteristics of the given animal to the
            <br/>
            same type
            <br/>
            of measured characteristics for other members of the same population. This
            <br/>
            approach is particularly advantageous as it may serve to eliminate systematic
            <br/>
            errors
            <br/>
            and conditions, such as, but not limited to, weather, feeding conditions,
            <br/>
            watering
            <br/>
            conditions, events that may disrupt herd feeding patterns and the like. It is
            <br/>
            recognized herein that the animals may be statistically binned into like sub-
            <br/>
            sets for
            <br/>
            the purposes of comparison. For instance, animals may be limited to comparison
            <br/>
            <br/>
            with animals of the same or similar age or weight. In another instance,
            <br/>
            animals may
            <br/>
            be limited to comparison with animals of the same sex. In another instance,
            <br/>
            animals
            <br/>
            may be limited to comparison with animals located in the same spatial region
            <br/>
            of the
            <br/>
            general animal holding area at a particular time of the day (in order to
            <br/>
            eliminate
            <br/>
            systematic affects such as sunlight and etc.).
            <br/>
            [0060] It is further recognized that the behavior may be averaged over a
            <br/>
            selected
            <br/>
            time period prior to comparison. In the event any one or more of the measured
            <br/>
            characteristics deviates (by a selected threshold) from that of the other
            <br/>
            animal(s), the
            <br/>
            controller 108 may notify a user that the deviant animal is unhealthy or
            <br/>
            potentially
            <br/>
            unhealthy.
            <br/>
            [0061] In another embodiment, an unhealthy animal is identified by monitoring
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            one or more measured characteristics of the animal as a function of time
            <br/>
            and/or
            <br/>
            location. For example, one or more measured physiological and/or behavior
            <br/>
            characteristics for an animal may be monitored as a function of time. In this
            <br/>
            regard,
            <br/>
            physiological and/or behavior characteristics measured at a first time
            <br/>
            instance (or
            <br/>
            across a first time interval) may compared to one or more measured
            <br/>
            physiological
            <br/>
            and/or behavior characteristics at a second time instance (or across a second
            <br/>
            time
            <br/>
            interval) (and a third time instance, a fourth time instance and so on). In
            <br/>
            this regard,
            <br/>
            the controller 108 may identify an unhealthy animal, or a potentially
            <br/>
            unhealthy
            <br/>
            animal, by observing deviations in the animal's behavior as a function of
            <br/>
            time. In the
            <br/>
            event any one or more of the measured characteristics exceeds a selected
            <br/>
            threshold, the controller 108 may notify a user that the animal is unhealthy
            <br/>
            or
            <br/>
            potentially unhealthy. This approach is particularly healthy in cases where a
            <br/>
            given
            <br/>
            23
            <br/>
            <br/>
            CA 03007296 2018-06-01
            <br/>
            WO 2017/096256                                            PCT/US2016/064761
            <br/>
            animal, while in a healthy state, displays physiological and/or behavioral
            <br/>
            characteristics that deviates from other members of the herd.
            <br/>
            [0062] It is further noted that the controller 108 may identify an unhealthy
            <br/>
            animal
            <br/>
            using any combination of the analysis approaches set forth above. For example,
            <br/>
            an
            <br/>
            unhealthy animal may be identified through implementation of any of the
            <br/>
            following: a
            <br/>
            preloaded database, comparison to other members of the population and/or
            <br/>
            monitoring a single animal as a function of time or location.
            <br/>
            [0063] In one embodiment, the controller 108 (or controllers) may receive
            <br/>
            instructions from a user device (e.g., user device 112a or user device 112b).
            <br/>
            In this
            <br/>
            regard, a user may select what comparisons he/she wants the controller 108 to
            <br/>
            perform. Then, the controller may transmit those results to the user. In
            <br/>
            another
            <br/>
            embodiment, the system 100 may include a mobile device separate from a first
            <br/>
            user
            <br/>
            device. In this regard, the results, or a sub-set of the results, may be
            <br/>
            delivered to
            <br/>
            another user remotely. For example, simplified data outputs may be transmitted
            <br/>
            to
            <br/>

            <br/>
            [0064] FIGS. 1K and 1L illustrate a mobile concentrator 104, in accordance
            <br/>
            with
            <br/>
            one or more embodiments of the present disclosure. In one embodiment, as shown
            <br/>
            <br/>
            in FIG. 1K, the concentrator 104 is user-carried. For example, a user 164 may
            <br/>
            carry
            <br/>
            the concentrator 104 and selectively interrogate the tag assemblies 102 of the
            <br/>
            <br/>
            various animals of an animal population 150. This embodiment may be
            <br/>
            particularly
            <br/>
            useful in the context where physiological and/or behavioral characteristic
            <br/>
            data are
            <br/>
            stored on board the tag assembly 102. In another embodiment, as shown in FIG.
            <br/>
            1L, the concentrator is drone-mounted. For example, the concentrator 104 may
            <br/>
            be
            <br/>
            mounted to a drone 165. In this regard, the drone 165 may selectively
            <br/>
            interrogate
            <br/>
            the tag assemblies 102 of the various animals of the animal population. Such a
            <br/>
            <br/>
            configuration would allow for a single concentrator to service multiple feed
            <br/>
            lot pens.
            <br/>
            [0065] It is further noted that the present disclosure is not limited to the
            <br/>
            above
            <br/>
            examples and is not limited to tracking physiological and/or behavioral
            <br/>
            characteristics of cattle. It is noted that the present disclosure may be
            <br/>
            extended to a
            <br/>
            wide variety of environments, such as, but not limited to tracking and
            <br/>
            predicting
            <br/>
            health states in pigs, horses, sheep, pets (e.g., dogs, cats and etc.), zoo

            etc. Further, the present disclosure may further be used to track and/or
            <br/>
            predict health
            <br/>
            states in humans, such as children in a daycare, athletes on a sports team or
            <br/>
            patients in a hospital facility.
            <br/>
            [0066] Referring again to FIGS. 1A-1D, it is noted that communication between
            <br/>
            a
            <br/>
            concentrator 104 and one or more tags 102 may include half-duplex and/or full-
            <br/>
            duplex communication systems. In one embodiment, a communication system
            <br/>
            between a tag 102 and a concentrator 104 includes a half-duplex communication
            <br/>
            system. In another embodiment, a communication system between a tag 102 and a
            <br/>
            concentrator 104 includes a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. In another
            <br/>
            embodiment, the MAC is time slotted. In one embodiment, the communication data
            <br/>
            <br/>
            rate between a concentrator 104 and one or more tags 102 is between 1, 000 and
            <br/>
            <br/>
            100, 0000 bits/sec. For example, the communication date rate may be, but it
            <br/>
            not
            <br/>
            limited to, 57,600 bits/sec, which provides a data period of approximately 6.6
            <br/>
            <br/>
            milliseconds. It is noted herein that the data rate of 57,600 bits/sec is not
            <br/>
            intended
            <br/>
            as limiting and other data rates may be used within the scope of the present
            <br/>
            disclosure.
            <br/>
            [0067] In one embodiment, the MAC includes a global data period of a selected
            <br/>
            length that defines the frequency of data collection. For example, the global
            <br/>
            data
            <br/>
            period may have a length of 3 seconds. It is noted herein that this data
            <br/>
            period is not
            <br/>
            limiting and that longer or shorter data periods may be used within the scope
            <br/>
            of the
            <br/>
            present disclosure.                                                        It
            <br/>
            is further noted that data need not be collected by a
            <br/>
            concentrator 104 during each data period; this configuration may be useful,
            <br/>
            for
            <br/>
            example, in order to manage power consumption and extend battery life. In one
            <br/>
            embodiment, the global data period is divided into a selected number slots.
            <br/>
            For
            <br/>
            example, the global data period may be divided into 120 time slots. In another
            <br/>
            <br/>
            embodiment, the width of each time slot within a data packet is a selected
            <br/>
            time
            <br/>
            period. For example, the time period may be 25 milliseconds.               In
            <br/>
            another
            <br/>
            embodiment, the 120 time slots are further divided into 1 beacon time slot, 9
            <br/>
            provisioning time slots, and 110 data collection time slots. In this way, data
            <br/>
            from 110
            <br/>
            tags 102 may be collected from a single concentrator 104. It is noted herein
            <br/>
            that the
            <br/>
            specific values of the width of the time slots and the number of time slots
            <br/>
            within a
            <br/>
            global data period is not limiting. It is further noted that choosing a time
            <br/>
            slot width
            <br/>
            <br/>
            CA 03007296 2018-06-01
            <br/>
            WO 2017/096256                                            PCT/US2016/064761
            <br/>
            larger than the data rate period (e.g. a 25 millisecond time slot width in
            <br/>
            relation to a
            <br/>
            data period of 6.6 milliseconds) enables time guard banding. In this regard,
            <br/>
            the local
            <br/>
            clocks of a concentrator 104 and one or more tags 102 may run fast or slow
            <br/>
            relative
            <br/>
            to each other with minimal synchronization error.
            <br/>
            [0068] In another embodiment, a data packet transmitted during a global data
            <br/>
            period comprises 48 bytes and consists of the following components: a preamble
            <br/>
            of
            <br/>
            8 bytes, a sync word of 4 bytes, a payload size of 1 byte, a payload of up to
            <br/>
            33
            <br/>
            bytes, and a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) of 2 bytes. It is noted herein that
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            contents and structure of the data packet are not limiting and other data
            <br/>
            packets with
            <br/>
            different contents and/or structure may be used within the scope of the
            <br/>
            present
            <br/>
            disclosure.
            <br/>
            [0069] It is noted herein that the purpose of a beacon signal is to provide a
            <br/>
            mechanism for synchronizing the concentrator 104 with one or more tags 102
            <br/>
            such
            <br/>
            that each tag 102 may properly transmit data in a designated time slot. In one
            <br/>
            <br/>
            embodiment, the one or more processors 116 of a tag (e.g. 102a) direct the
            <br/>
            data
            <br/>
            radio (e.g. the communication circuitry 120) to turn on only when a beacon
            <br/>
            signal is
            <br/>
            expected in order to conserve power. If a beacon is received, the timing
            <br/>
            circuitry
            <br/>
            (not shown) of the tag 102 is synchronized to the beacon signal such that the
            <br/>
            timing
            <br/>
            of the remaining time slots are synchronized between the collector 104 and the
            <br/>
            tag
            <br/>
            102.
            <br/>
            [0070] FIG. 1M illustrates a flow diagram depicting a communication protocol
            <br/>
            between a tag 102 and a concentrator 104, in accordance with one or more
            <br/>
            embodiments of the present disclosure.
            <br/>
            [0071] In one embodiment, the logical flow the tag 102 and the logical flow of
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            concentrator 104 are independent, which is to say that each element contains
            <br/>
            separate timing circuitry (not shown).
            <br/>
            [0072] In one embodiment, a tag 102 collects data 171 from one or more sensors
            <br/>
            <br/>
            114. In one embodiment, the one or more processors 116 of a tag (e.g. 102a)
            <br/>
            direct
            <br/>
            the data radio (e.g. the communication circuitry 126) to turn on 172 only when
            <br/>
            a
            <br/>
            beacon signal is expected to be transmitted from the concentrator 104 in order
            <br/>
            to
            <br/>
            conserve power. The tag 102 will then search 173 for a beacon signal. If a
            <br/>
            beacon
            <br/>

            <br/>
            WO 2017/096256                                            PCT/US2016/064761
            <br/>
            signal is not found 175, the tag 102 will continue to search 180 for a beacon
            <br/>
            signal
            <br/>
            for up to 8 global data periods (or any other selected number of global data
            <br/>
            periods).
            <br/>
            If no beacon signal is found 175 within 8 global data periods 180, the tag 102
            <br/>
            enters
            <br/>
            a search mode 181. In the search mode, the one or more processors 116 direct
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            data radio to toggle on and off every 4 seconds (or any other selected time
            <br/>
            period)
            <br/>
            such that the tag 102 searches for a beacon signal when the data radio is on.
            <br/>
            It is
            <br/>
            noted herein that one purpose of the search mode is to conserve power while
            <br/>
            searching for a beacon signal. It is further noted herein that the specific
            <br/>
            values of 8
            <br/>
            global data periods required to enter the search mode and a toggle time of 4
            <br/>
            seconds are not intended to be limiting and are provided merely for
            <br/>
            illustrative
            <br/>
            purposes.
            <br/>
            [0073] In another embodiment, if a beacon signal is received 175 by a tag 102,
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            local clock will be synchronized 176 to the beacon signal. In one embodiment,
            <br/>
            if a
            <br/>
            tag 102 does not have a beacon signal then a provisioning packet is
            <br/>
            transmitted 182
            <br/>
            to the concentrator 104 in one of the provisioning timeslots. It is noted
            <br/>
            herein that
            <br/>
            the specific provisioning time slot may be chosen either at random or may be
            <br/>
            fixed
            <br/>
            for a given tag 102. If the concentrator 104 receives a provisioning packet
            <br/>
            189 in
            <br/>
            one of the provisioning time slots, the concentrator 104 transmits a data
            <br/>
            timeslot to
            <br/>
            the tag 102. If the tag 102 properly receives the transmitted data timeslot,
            <br/>
            the tag
            <br/>
            102 transmits an acknowledgement signal 184. If the acknowledgement signal is
            <br/>
            properly received 191 by the concentrator 104, a final confirmation signal is
            <br/>
            transmitted 192 to the tag 102 in order to confirm 185 the timeslot for the
            <br/>
            tag 102.
            <br/>
            The concentrator 104 then associates 19 the allotted time slot with the tag
            <br/>
            102. It is
            <br/>
            noted herein that the association of a timeslot with a tag 102 may be
            <br/>
            accomplished
            <br/>
            using any method known in the art including, but not limited to, storage of
            <br/>
            the serial
            <br/>
            number of the tag 102 or the use of another identification number. If any of
            <br/>
            the steps
            <br/>
            associated with the assignment of a timeslot to a tag 102 fails (e.g., steps
            <br/>
            182, 189,
            <br/>
            190, 183, 184, 191, 192, or 185), the tag 102 does not have an assigned
            <br/>
            timeslot
            <br/>
            232 and the tag will transmit a provisioning packet 182 on the next global
            <br/>
            data
            <br/>
            period. It is noted herein that the steps associated with the assignment of a
            <br/>

            to a tag 102 (e.g., steps 182, 189, 190, 183, 184, 191, 192, or 185) are not
            <br/>
            intended
            <br/>
            to be limiting. By way of non-limiting example, any of steps 182, 189, 190,
            <br/>
            183, 184,
            <br/>
            191, 192, or 185 may be omitted. Alternatively, by way of non-limiting

            additional communication signals (not shown) may be utilized to ensure proper
            <br/>
            assignment of a timeslot to a tag 102.
            <br/>
            [0074] In another embodiment, if a tag 102 has an assigned timeslot 177, the
            <br/>
            tag
            <br/>
            102 transmits health data 178 to the concentrator 104 during the appropriate
            <br/>
            timeslot. The one or more processors 116 of the tag 102 then direct the data
            <br/>
            radio
            <br/>
            to turn off 179 for the remainder of the global data period. During this time,
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            concentrator 104 receives data from all timeslots 194. At the start of the
            <br/>
            next data
            <br/>
            period, the concentrator repeats the process, beginning with the transmission
            <br/>
            of a
            <br/>
            beacon signal 188. It is noted herein that the tag may monitor health data
            <br/>
            using the
            <br/>
            one or more sensors 114 continuously throughout the communication cycle.
            <br/>
            [0075] It is noted herein that if a concentrator 104 loses a listing of
            <br/>
            assigned time
            <br/>
            slots associated with one or more tags 102 (e.g., upon reboot), the one or
            <br/>
            more tags
            <br/>
            102 may continue to send data during a previously assigned time slot. The
            <br/>
            concentrator 104 will then rebuild a listing of assigned time slots associated
            <br/>
            with the
            <br/>
            one or more tags 102 according to order of received data in the data time
            <br/>
            slots. It is
            <br/>
            further noted that this procedure may be carried out in order to prevent all
            <br/>
            of the one
            <br/>
            or more tags 102 from simultaneously transmitting provisioning packets 182,
            <br/>
            which
            <br/>
            may lead to assignment errors.

            <br/>
            <br/>
            known in the art. However, the tag body 202 of the present disclosure may be
            <br/>
            further
            <br/>
            functionalized with the components of the tag assembly 102, described
            <br/>
            previously
            <br/>
            herein. For example, as shown in FIG. 2A, the components of the tag assembly
            <br/>
            102
            <br/>
            may be disposed on one or more surfaces of the tag body 202 or encased within
            <br/>

            <br/>
            [0077] In one embodiment, the one or more sensors 114 may include one or more
            <br/>
            temperature probes 206 (e.g., thermopile, IR sensor, RTD and the like). The
            <br/>
            one or
            <br/>
            more temperature probe 206 may be positioned on the tag body 202 such that it
            <br/>
            resides in close proximity with a portion of the tagged animal so that
            <br/>
            temperature
            <br/>
            measurements are satisfactorily accurate.
            <br/>
            [0078] In another embodiment, the one or more sensors 114 may include one or
            <br/>
            more accelerometers 208 (e.g., three-axis accelerometer). In another
            <br/>
            embodiment,
            <br/>
            the one or more sensors 114 may include one or more magnetometers 210. In
            <br/>
            another embodiment, the one or more sensors 114 may include a IMU.
            <br/>
            [0079] In another embodiment, the communication circuitry 120 of the tag
            <br/>
            assembly
            <br/>
            102 may be disposed on a first surface (e.g., front surface in FIG. 2A) of the
            <br/>
            tag body
            <br/>
            202. The communication circuitry 120 may include any communication circuitry
            <br/>

            <br/>
            120 may include, but is not limited to, a RF module (e.g., LEBT module). In
            <br/>
            another
            <br/>
            embodiment, the one or more batteries 121 of the tag assembly 102 may be
            <br/>
            disposed on the first surface (e.g., front surface in FIG. 2A) of the tag body
            <br/>
            202.
            <br/>
            [ono] It is further noted that the arrangement of the sensors 114,
            <br/>
            communication
            <br/>
            circuitry 120 and battery 121 is provided merely for illustrative purposes. It
            <br/>
            is
            <br/>
            recognized that the components may be arranged in any number of
            <br/>
            configurations.
            <br/>
            For example, a portion of the components may be disposed on a first surface of
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            tag body, while a second portion of the components may be disposed on a second
            <br/>
            <br/>
            surface of the tag body 202.
            <br/>
            [0081] In another embodiment, the tag body 202 of the tag assembly 102 may be
            <br/>
            secured to a portion of the animal (e.g., ear of the animal) using the tag
            <br/>
            connector
            <br/>
            204. In another embodiment, as shown in FIG. 2B, one or more sensors 114,
            <br/>
            communication circuitry and/or the battery 121 may be disposed on an
            <br/>
            independent
            <br/>
            sensor unit 212. In one embodiment, the sensor unit 212 may be coupled to the
            <br/>
            backside portion of the tag connector 204.
            <br/>
            [0082] In another embodiment, the tag assembly 102 need not include the tag
            <br/>
            body
            <br/>
            202. For example, as shown in FIG. 2C, the tag assembly 102 includes a sensor
            <br/>
            unit 212, which may be coupled directly to a portion of the animal (e.g., ear)
            <br/>
            using

            the connector 204. Again, one or more sensors 114, communication circuitry
            <br/>
            and/or
            <br/>
            the battery 121 may be disposed on an independent sensor unit 212. Such a
            <br/>
            configuration may be particularly advantageous when close contact between one
            <br/>
            or
            <br/>
            more of the sensors (e.g., temperature probe) and an ear portion of the animal
            <br/>
            is
            <br/>
            desired. As shown in FIG. 2C, direction contact can be made between the sensor
            <br/>
            <br/>
            114 (e.g., temperature probe) of the sensor unit 212 and a portion of the ear
            <br/>
            of the
            <br/>
            animal.
            <br/>
            [0083] FIGD. 2D illustrates a schematic view of tag assembly 102, in
            <br/>
            accordance
            <br/>
            with one or more additional embodiments of the present disclosure.         In
            <br/>
            this
            <br/>
            embodiment, the tag assembly 102 includes an elongated tag body 202 that when
            <br/>
            attached to an ear of an animal with the tag connector 204 may hang from the
            <br/>
            ear of
            <br/>
            the animal. For example, the ear of the animal (not shown in FIG. 2D) may be
            <br/>
            situated between the tag body 202 an the base of the ear connector 204 once
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            tag connector 204 is pushed through the ear of the animal and coupled to the
            <br/>
            receiving hole of the tag body 202.
            <br/>
            [0084] In this embodiment, one or more sensors 114 are disposed on one or more
            <br/>
            <br/>
            surfaces of the tag body or within (all or a portion) of the volume of the tag
            <br/>
            body. For
            <br/>
            instance, the various sensors 114 may be molded within a plastic tag body. In
            <br/>
            another embodiment, a portion of the one or more sensors may be exposed in
            <br/>
            order
            <br/>
            to enhance measurements of one or more parameters.
            <br/>
            [0085] The one or more sensors 114, as discussed previously herein, may
            <br/>
            include
            <br/>
            any sensor technology known in the art for measuring physiological and/or
            <br/>
            behavioral parameters. For example, the one or more sensors 114 may include,
            <br/>
            but
            <br/>
            are not limited to, a temperature sensor (e.g., IR temperature sensor,
            <br/>
            thermocouple,
            <br/>
            thermistor and the like), a heart rate monitor (e.g., optical heart monitor),
            <br/>
            an
            <br/>
            accelerometer, a magnetometer, a gyroscope, an inertial measurement unit, a
            <br/>
            location sensor, a chemical sensor and the like. In the embodiment depicted in
            <br/>
            FIG.
            <br/>
            2D, the one or more sensors 114 include a temperature sensor 206, an
            <br/>
            accelerometer 208, and a gyroscope 209. It is noted that the tag assembly of

            <br/>
            [0086] In the case of the temperature sensor 206, the temperature sensor 206
            <br/>
            may
            <br/>
            be integrated into the tag body 202 of the tag 102 such that it is exposed at
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            surface of the tag facing the connect 204. Such a configuration provides for
            <br/>
            adequate contact to the animal's ear (in the case a thermistor or thermocouple
            <br/>
            bases
            <br/>
            temperature sensor) and/or line of sight (in the case of an IR-based

            temperature
            <br/>
            sensor).
            <br/>
            [0087] In another embodiment, the tag 102 may be equipped with one or more
            <br/>
            processors 116 and memory 117. In another embodiment, the tag 102 may be
            <br/>
            equipped with communication circuitry 120 (e.g., antenna) for communicating
            <br/>
            with
            <br/>
            the concentrator 104.
            <br/>
            [0088] In one embodiment, the one or more sensors 114 sensors may collect data
            <br/>
            <br/>
            associated with the animal's movements, activity, and/or temperature. Data may

            be
            <br/>
            stored in memory 117. In another embodiment, the data may be processed or pre-
            <br/>
            process on the tag 102 via the one or more processors 116. In another

            to the
            <br/>
            concentrator 104 via the communication circuitry 120. As discussed previously
            <br/>
            herein, the concentrator 104, or base station, may be communicatively coupled
            <br/>
            to a
            <br/>
            secure cloud (i.e., server), where the various data results can be analyzed
            <br/>
            and
            <br/>
            decisions can be made about the state of the tagged animal. An indicator
            <br/>
            indicative
            <br/>
            of a particular decision related to the tagged animal may then be transmitted
            <br/>
            to one
            <br/>
            or more user devise 110a-110c so that that user may take action in regard to
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            animal.
            <br/>
            [0089] In another embodiment, the tag 102 includes one or more indicators. For
            <br/>
            <br/>
            example, the tag 102 may include one or more LEDs 216. In this regard, one or
            <br/>
            more signals indicative of the state of the tagged animal may be transmitted
            <br/>
            back to
            <br/>
            the tag 102 on the given animal from the concentrator 104. In one embodiment,
            <br/>
            based on the state of health of the animal, the LED may be activated. For
            <br/>
            example,
            <br/>
            the tag 102 may be programmed to activate the LED when one or more parameters
            <br/>
            falls below a selected threshold. In this regard, the LED may be activated
            <br/>
            when the
            <br/>
            animal is in need of attention. By way of another example, the LED may be
            <br/>
            activated when the animal is deemed in good health. Alternatively, different
            <br/>
            colors of

            <br/>
            LED may be used for different health states (e.g., green for satisfactory
            <br/>
            health
            <br/>
            condition, red for less-than-satisfactory health condition).
            <br/>
            [0090] In another embodiment, feedback from the concentrator 104/controller
            <br/>
            108
            <br/>
            to the tag 102 may update the sampling conditions of the given tag 102. For
            <br/>
            example, in a situation where the given animal is in a poor or stressed health
            <br/>
            state,
            <br/>
            the concentrator 104/controller 108 may direct the tag 102 to increase the
            <br/>
            sampling
            <br/>
            rate or change the parameters that are sampled.
            <br/>
            [0091] In another embodiment, diagnostic decisions may be made by
            <br/>
            users/manager themselves based on the measured parameters, such as, but not
            <br/>
            limited to, movement, activity, and/or temperature.
            <br/>

            <br/>
            devices. In this regard, a particular animal may be identified utilizing an
            <br/>
            RFID
            <br/>
            reader. For example, the RFID may include, but is not limited to, a low
            <br/>
            frequency
            <br/>
            passive RFID device. By way of another example, the RFID may include, but is
            <br/>
            not
            <br/>
            limited to, an active RFID device.
            <br/>
            [0093] In another embodiment, the tag 102 may be equipped with one or more
            <br/>
            communication lines (not shown) for communicatively connecting the various
            <br/>
            components of the tag 102 to each other and/or to the communication circuitry
            <br/>

            the tag assembly 300 as attached to the ear of the animal (e.g., cow). As
            <br/>
            shown in
            <br/>
            FIGS. 3C-3D, the tag assembly 300 is suitable for attaching to the ear at a
            <br/>
            position
            <br/>
            (marked by "X") that is approximately between the head of the cow and the end
            <br/>
            of
            <br/>
            the ear. In addition, the tag assembly 300 may be placed between the 2nd and
            <br/>

            <br/>
            of the
            <br/>
            ear). In this regard, the tag assembly may be placed on the inner part of the
            <br/>
            middle
            <br/>
            3rd of the ear with the antenna end of the tag assembly 300 situated at the
            <br/>
            outer
            <br/>
            edge of the ear. This will allow the tag to sit in the groove between the
            <br/>
            cartilage
            <br/>
            ridges, which will aid in maintaining a more constant temperature as well as
            <br/>
            allowing
            <br/>
            a sensor to measure the temperature of the inner ear canal itself.

            [0099] In one embodiment, the tag body 402 may be secured to a portion of the
            <br/>
            animal (e.g., ear of the animal) via one or more connection pass-throughs (or
            <br/>
            holes)
            <br/>
            408a, 408b. It is noted that the number of connector pass-throughs of the tag
            <br/>
            assembly 400 defines the number of attachment points to the animal. It is
            <br/>
            further
            <br/>
            noted that the number and orientation of the one or more contact points may
            <br/>
            influence the stability of the tag assembly 400 on the animal. For example,
            <br/>
            the use
            <br/>
            of two or more punches aids in reducing rotation of the tag assembly 400 out
            <br/>
            of the
            <br/>
            animal's ear.

            <br/>
            temperature
            <br/>
            sensor). For example, the first sensor 404 may be used to measure the ear
            <br/>
            canal
            <br/>
            temperature of the animal, while the second sensor 406 may be used to measure
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            temperature of the face of the ear of the animal. It is noted herein that the
            <br/>
            tag
            <br/>
            assembly 400 is not limited to the sensor configuration described above.

            second punch 512 may correspond with the spacing of the connection pass-
            <br/>
            throughs, or holes, 408a, 408b or tag assembly 400.                        It
            <br/>
            is noted herein that the
            <br/>
            crimper tool 500 is not limited to two punches or the arrangement depicted in
            <br/>
            FIGS.
            <br/>
            5A and 5B. Rather, the punch configuration of FIGS. 5A and 5B are provided
            <br/>
            merely
            <br/>
            for illustrative purposes. For example, the punch assembly 508 may include any
            <br/>
            <br/>
            number of punches (e.g., two, three, four and so on) and may be arranged in
            <br/>
            any
            <br/>
            geometrical arranged so as to corresponding with the connection pass-throughs
            <br/>
            of
            <br/>
            the tag assembly 400.
            <br/>
            [00102] It is noted that when operated a user presses the first arm 504 and
            <br/>
            second
            <br/>
            arm 506 together, which serves to drive the punches 510, 512 through the
            <br/>
            animal's
            <br/>
            ear. It is further noted that the first punch 510 and the second punch 512
            <br/>
            have
            <br/>
            different lengths. A first punch 510 is longer than the second punch 512 so
            <br/>
            that the
            <br/>
            first punch 510 pierces a portion of an animal before the second punch 512
            <br/>
            begins
            <br/>
            piercing the portion of the animal. In this manner, the punches 510, 512
            <br/>
            serves to
            <br/>
            spread out the application of force to the animal's ear over time.
            <br/>
            Such a
            <br/>
            configuration serves to reduce the maximum amount of applied force relative to
            <br/>
            two
            <br/>
            punches of identical length, which alleviates stress on the animal and allows
            <br/>
            for
            <br/>
            easier application by the user.

            <br/>
            structure of
            <br/>
            the tag assembly 600. As shown in FIGS. 6A-6C, the tag body 602 of tag
            <br/>
            assembly
            <br/>
            600 may be configured for being stapled to the ear of an animal with one or
            <br/>
            more
            <br/>
            staples 604. For example, as shown in FIGS. 6B and 6C, the tag body 602
            <br/>
            includes
            <br/>
            two or more pass through holes 605 to allow one or more connections of one or

            600
            <br/>
            within the canal of the animal's ear (as shown in FIG. 6D). While the examples
            <br/>
            <br/>
            provided in FIGS. 6A-6E illustrate a single staple, such a configuration is
            <br/>
            not a
            <br/>
            limitation on the present disclosure and it is recognized that the various tag
            <br/>
            <br/>
            assemblies of the present disclosure, such as, but not limited to, tag
            <br/>
            assembly 600
            <br/>
            may be connected to an animal's ear (or other portion of their body) with any
            <br/>
            number
            <br/>
            of staples or other connection devices. As noted previously herein, the tag
            <br/>
            assembly
            <br/>
            600 may be placed between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage ridges (as shown in FIG.
            <br/>
            3D,
            <br/>
            at the inside edge of the middle third of the ear).
            <br/>
            [00105] In another embodiment, as shown in FIG. 6F, the tag assembly 600
            <br/>
            includes
            <br/>
            a backing layer 610. In one embodiment, the backing layer 610 may be
            <br/>
            positioned
            <br/>
            on the backside of an animal's ear and serves to provide structural support so
            <br/>
            as to
            <br/>
            limit damage and pain to the animal's ear cause by the staple 604. In one

            <br/>
            600 (or any other tag assembly), depicted in FIG. 6A, to an ear of an animal.
            <br/>
            In one
            <br/>
            embodiment, the connecting portions of a staple may be forced through the base
            <br/>
            <br/>
            portion of the tag assembly 600 to form the one or more holes 605. In this
            <br/>
            regard, at
            <br/>
            least the base of the tag assembly 600 may be formed from a material with
            <br/>
            which the
            <br/>
            connecting portions of a staple may pass through, while also providing
            <br/>
            structural
            <br/>
            integrity so as to maintain connection to the animal's ear. For instance, at
            <br/>
            least the
            <br/>
            base of the tag assembly 600 may be formed from a plastic, rubber or like
            <br/>

            <br/>
            any stapling
            <br/>
            unit or stapler known in the art. For example, as shown in FIG. 6S, the
            <br/>
            stapling unit
            <br/>
            652 may include a stapler mechanism 659 or device for forcing one or more
            <br/>
            staples
            <br/>
            604 through the animal's ear and securing the tag assembly 600 to the animal's
            <br/>
            ear
            <br/>
            by bending the end portions of the staple (e.g., bent staple in FIG. 6D). For
            <br/>
            instance,
            <br/>
            upon pulling trigger 655, the stapler mechanism 659 may force a staple 604
            <br/>
            through
            <br/>
            the animal's ear and a portion of the tag assembly 600 so as to secure the tag
            <br/>
            <br/>
            assembly 600 to the animal's ear. Further, as shown in FIG. 6S, the stapling
            <br/>
            unit
            <br/>
            652 may include a staple supply unit 657 (e.g., staple tray located beneath
            <br/>
            handle
            <br/>
            653 of stapling unit 652).
            <br/>
            [0ono] In another embodiment, as shown in FIG. 6T, the stapling tool 650
            <br/>
            includes
            <br/>
            a tag securing bracket 654. The bracket 654 may be shaped so as to conform to
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            37

            <br/>
            place,
            <br/>
            while the stapling mechanism 659 drives a staple through the animal's ear and
            <br/>
            through the base portion of the tag assembly 600. For example, during
            <br/>
            application
            <br/>
            of a tag assembly 600 to an ear of animal, the animal's ear may be positioned
            <br/>
            between the tag assembly 600 held in bracket 654 and the stapling mechanism
            <br/>
            659.
            <br/>
            Further, the bracket 654 may provide an opposing portion or face that serves
            <br/>
            to bend
            <br/>
            the end of the staple 604 after it is forced through the animal's ear and the
            <br/>
            base of
            <br/>
            the tag assembly 600.
            <br/>
            [ow 11] In another embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 6U-6Y, the stapling tool 650
            <br/>
            includes a tag assembly magazine 656 for holding multiple tag assemblies 600.
            <br/>
            For
            <br/>
            example, as shown in FIG. 6U, the tag assembly magazine may include a spring
            <br/>
            658
            <br/>
            for pushing the tag assemblies 600 into position for application. In this
            <br/>
            regard, once a
            <br/>
            first tag assembly 600 is applied to an animal's ear, the spring 658 pushes
            <br/>
            the tag
            <br/>
            assemblies 600 up so the next tag assembly moves into position for tagging.
            <br/>
            The
            <br/>
            use of magazine 656 allows for the tagging of multiple animals in rapid
            <br/>
            succession.
            <br/>
            The tag assembly magazine 656 may be configured in any manner suitable manner.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            For example, as shown in FIG. 6U, the tag assembly magazine 656 is arranged in
            <br/>
            a
            <br/>
            vertical configuration. By way of another example, as shown in FIGS. 6V-6W,
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            tag assembly 656 may be arranged in a horizontal configuration. By way of
            <br/>
            another
            <br/>
            example, as shown in the end view of FIG. 6X, the tag assembly 656 may be
            <br/>
            arranged in a side-loading vertical configuration. By way of another example,
            <br/>
            as
            <br/>
            shown in the end view of FIG. 6Y, the tag assembly 656 may arranged in a side-
            <br/>
            loading horizontal configuration. It is noted herein that the present
            <br/>
            disclosure is not
            <br/>
            limited to the magazine configurations provide above, which are provided
            <br/>
            merely for
            <br/>
            illustrative purposes. For example, the tag assembly magazine may be arranged
            <br/>
            in
            <br/>
            a drum or circular configuration.
            <br/>
            [00112] It is noted herein that the stapling tool 650 of the present
            <br/>
            disclosure is not
            <br/>
            limited to the application of tag assembly 600 or any other tag assembly
            <br/>
            described
            <br/>
            previously herein. It is recognized herein that the stapling tool 650 may be
            <br/>
            used to
            <br/>
            connect any tag or tag assembly known in the art to a portion (e.g., ear) of
            <br/>
            an animal
            <br/>
            with one or more staples. FIG. 7A illustrates a schematic view 700 of a
            <br/>
            passive tag

            702. In one embodiment, the stapling tool 650 may be used to connect the
            <br/>
            passive
            <br/>
            tag 702 to a portion of the animal via staple 604. In this regard, the
            <br/>
            connecting
            <br/>
            portions (e.g., parallel straight portions) of the stable 604 are forced
            <br/>
            through a
            <br/>
            portion of the passive tag 702 to form holes 704. As noted previously herein,
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            bracket 654 (shown in FIGS. 6F-6J) may bend the portions of the staple, which
            <br/>
            serves to secure the passive tag 702 to the animal.
            <br/>
            [00113] FIG. 7B illustrates a schematic view 710 of a retrofitted passive tag
            <br/>
            712. In
            <br/>
            one embodiment, an adapter assembly 715 may be used to allow for stapling of
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            tag 712 to an animal. For example, the adapter assembly 715 may include a
            <br/>
            connector 708 that passes through the pass-through hole 710. Such a
            <br/>
            configuration
            <br/>
            then provides a connecting surface for receiving staple 604. For example, the
            <br/>
            staple
            <br/>
            tool 650 may drive the staple 604 through the connecting surface of the
            <br/>
            adapter
            <br/>
            assembly 715, thereby forming holes 706. In this regard, the ear of the animal
            <br/>
            may
            <br/>
            be placed between the connecting surface of the adapter assembly 715 and the
            <br/>
            stapling mechanism 659 (shown in FIGS. 65-6Y) so that the staple 604 secures
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            retrofitted passive tag 712 to the animal's ear.
            <br/>
            [00114] All of the embodiments described herein may include storing results of
            <br/>
            one
            <br/>
            or more steps in a storage medium. The results may include any of the results
            <br/>
            described herein and may be stored in any manner known in the art. The storage
            <br/>
            <br/>
            medium may include any storage medium described herein or any other suitable
            <br/>
            storage medium known in the art. After the results have been stored, the
            <br/>
            results can
            <br/>
            be accessed in the storage medium and used by any of the method or system
            <br/>
            embodiments described herein, formatted for display to a user, used by another
            <br/>
            <br/>
            software module, method, or system, etc. Furthermore, the results may be
            <br/>
            stored
            <br/>
            "permanently," "semi-permanently," temporarily, or for some period of time.
            <br/>
            For
            <br/>
            example, the storage medium may be random access memory (RAM), and the
            <br/>
            results may not necessarily persist indefinitely in the storage medium.
            <br/>
            [00115] Those having skill in the art will recognize that the state of the art
            <br/>
            has
            <br/>
            progressed to the point where there is little distinction left between
            <br/>
            hardware and
            <br/>
            software implementations of aspects of systems; the use of hardware or
            <br/>
            software is
            <br/>
            generally (but not always, in that in certain contexts the choice between
            <br/>
            hardware
            <br/>
            and software can become significant) a design choice representing cost vs.

            <br/>
            efficiency tradeoffs. Those having skill in the art will appreciate that there
            <br/>
            are
            <br/>
            various vehicles by which processes and/or systems and/or other technologies
            <br/>
            described herein can be effected (e.g., hardware, software, and/or firmware),
            <br/>
            and
            <br/>
            that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the processes
            <br/>
            and/or
            <br/>
            systems and/or other technologies are deployed. For example, if an implementer
            <br/>
            <br/>
            determines that speed and accuracy are paramount, the implementer may opt for
            <br/>
            a
            <br/>
            mainly hardware and/or firmware vehicle; alternatively, if flexibility is
            <br/>
            paramount, the
            <br/>
            implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation; or, yet again
            <br/>
            alternatively, the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware,
            <br/>
            software,
            <br/>
            and/or firmware. Hence, there are several possible vehicles by which the
            <br/>
            processes
            <br/>
            and/or devices and/or other technologies described herein may be effected,
            <br/>
            none of
            <br/>
            which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized
            <br/>
            is a choice
            <br/>
            dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the
            <br/>
            specific
            <br/>
            concerns (e.g., speed, flexibility, or predictability) of the implementer, any
            <br/>
            of which
            <br/>
            may vary.    Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of
            <br/>
            implementations will typically employ optically-oriented hardware, software,
            <br/>
            and or
            <br/>
            firmware.
            <br/>
            [00116] While particular aspects of the present subject matter described
            <br/>
            herein have
            <br/>
            been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art
            <br/>
            that, based
            <br/>
            upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without
            <br/>
            departing from the subject matter described herein and its broader aspects
            <br/>
            and,
            <br/>
            therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such
            <br/>
            changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of the
            <br/>
            subject
            <br/>
            matter described herein.
            <br/>
            [00117] Furthermore, it is to be understood that the invention is defined by
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            appended claims. It will be understood by those within the art that, in
            <br/>
            general, terms
            <br/>
            used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the
            <br/>
            appended
            <br/>
            claims) are generally intended as "open" terms (e.g., the term "including"
            <br/>
            should be
            <br/>
            interpreted as "including but not limited to," the term "having" should be
            <br/>
            interpreted
            <br/>
            as "having at least," the term "includes" should be interpreted as "includes
            <br/>
            but is not
            <br/>
            limited to," etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that
            <br/>
            if a specific
            <br/>
            number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be
            <br/>
            explicitly
            <br/>
            recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is
            <br/>
            present.

            <br/>
            For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may
            <br/>
            contain
            <br/>
            usage of the introductory phrases "at least one" and "one or more" to
            <br/>
            introduce claim
            <br/>
            recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply
            <br/>
            that
            <br/>
            the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles "a" or "an"
            <br/>
            limits any
            <br/>
            particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions
            <br/>
            containing
            <br/>
            only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory
            <br/>
            phrases "one or more" or "at least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or
            <br/>
            "an"
            <br/>
            (e.g., "a" and/or "an" should typically be interpreted to mean at least one"
            <br/>
            or one or
            <br/>
            more"); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce
            <br/>
            claim
            <br/>
            recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim
            <br/>
            recitation is
            <br/>
            explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such
            <br/>
            recitation should
            <br/>
            typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare
            <br/>
            recitation
            <br/>
            of "two recitations," without other modifiers, typically means at least two
            <br/>
            recitations,
            <br/>
            or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a
            <br/>
            convention
            <br/>
            analogous to at least one of A, B, and C, etc." is used, in general such a
            <br/>
            construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would
            <br/>
            understand the
            <br/>
            convention (e.g., " a system having at least one of A, B, and C" would include
            <br/>
            but not
            <br/>
            be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A

            and C
            <br/>
            together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those

            instances
            <br/>
            where a convention analogous to at least one of A, B, or C, etc." is used, in
            <br/>
            general
            <br/>
            such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would
