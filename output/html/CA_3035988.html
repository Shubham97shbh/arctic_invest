            <br/>
            plane vertical and/or perpendicular to the rest side of
            <br/>
            the containers and/or parallel to the axis of the
            <br/>
            containers and which loose strap surrounds the strap or
            <br/>
            straps applied in the first strapping station.
            <br/>
            2. Plant according to claim 1, wherein the lifting
            <br/>
            conveyor is configured for moving each group of
            <br/>
            containers of the sequence from an initial container
            <br/>
            infeed level in the lifting conveyor, to an
            <br/>
            intermediate lift level where there is provided the
            <br/>
            first strapping station and from this second level to a
            <br/>

            Ribi Limited.
            <br/>
            Plant for packing PVC bottles or other similar
            <br/>
            containers in packs by applying band-like bindings
            <br/>
            called also as straps.
            <br/>
            Currently in prior art beverage bottles 1 made of
            <br/>
            PET are packed into packs of four or six elements
            <br/>
            mainly by means of sheets made of heat-shrink plastic
            <br/>
            polymers.
            <br/>
            The present invention on the contrary relates to a
            <br/>
            new type of rapid packaging and therefore to a new type
            <br/>
            of safe and economic plant by using band-like bindings,
            <br/>
            that is straps 24 that can be applied with suitable and
            <br/>
            specific arrangements by conventional strapping
            <br/>
            machines.
            <br/>
            Said machines have already been used for a long
            <br/>
            time for packaging packs, boxes or various containers
            <br/>
            but they have not been industrially used yet for
            <br/>
            assembling PET bottles. Some isolated experimental
            <br/>
            attempts are only known however resulting in poor
            <br/>
            convincing results as regards efficacy and with poor
            <br/>
            implementation results.
            <br/>
            The invention aims at providing a strapping plant
            <br/>
            particularly for bottles but also for other similar
            <br/>
            containers that can overcome drawbacks of current
            <br/>
            attempts and that can make the strapping technology
            <br/>
            usable also for packs of containers.
            <br/>
            Particularly the invention provides to make a
            <br/>
            particular type of pack where an ordered group of
            <br/>
            bottles comprise a predetermined number of bottles with
            <br/>

            a given relative position with respect to each other
            <br/>
            and held together by at least one, preferably two
            <br/>
            straps oriented perpendicularly to the axes of the
            <br/>
            bottles.
            <br/>
            According to one embodiment said straps are
            <br/>
            provided also at a given distance one from each other.
            <br/>
            A third loose strap is provided arranged in a plane
            <br/>
            parallel to the axes of the bottles and surrounding at
            <br/>
            least one or both the horizontal straps thus forming an
            <br/>
            handle.
            <br/>
            The invention achieves the above aims by the
            <br/>
            combination of characteristics of claim 1.
            <br/>
            Therefore the invention provides a plant for
            <br/>
            applying straps to a group of containers such as
            <br/>
            bottles or the like, which group comprises a
            <br/>
            predetermined number of containers arranged according

            corresponding to the position they take in the group of
            <br/>
            containers provided with straps.
            <br/>
            The mutual tightening of the at least two
            <br/>
            containers in the central and intermediate position is
            <br/>
            provided with such a tightening force that, the
            <br/>
            friction between the contact areas of said two or more
            <br/>
            containers is increased to such an extent to at least
            <br/>
            restrain a mutual counter-rotation movement of the two
            <br/>
            or more containers or possibly also to prevent them
            <br/>
            from accomplishing such relative counter-rotation
            <br/>
            movement preventing the containers of the group from
            <br/>
            taking a quincunx position.
            <br/>
            Such solution is applied particularly in groups of

            DETAILLED DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION OF THE PLANT
            <br/>
            In the present description and in the claims the
            <br/>
            term strapped means the fact of having applied a strap.
            <br/>
            The term to strap means the action of applying one or
            <br/>
            more straps. The term strap means a flexible band-like
            <br/>
            and not elastically extensible element that is
            <br/>
            tightened around a group of objects, the two ends of
            <br/>
            said band being connected with each other such to
            <br/>
            firmly remain joined in the tightened condition.
            <br/>
            The plant of the present invention is about an
            <br/>
            operating unit able to perform a rapid packing, that is
            <br/>
            a safe, simple and transportable pack 1 obtained by
            <br/>
            means of three straps: one strap applied on the lower
            <br/>
            half of the body of the bottles 1, the second one
            <br/>
            applied at the neck of the bottles 1, both arranged on
            <br/>
            planes perpendicular to the vertical axes of the
            <br/>

            bottles 1, the third one, on the contrary, applied
            <br/>
            loose and perpendicular to the other two straps, lies
            <br/>
            on a vertical plane passing by the center of gravity of
            <br/>
            the pack, that is it is arranged on a plane comprised
            <br/>
            between two adjacent rows of bottles 1 in contact with
            <br/>
            each other for example in the plane that separates the
            <br/>
            two rows of three bottles 1 of the standard pack made
            <br/>
            of six bottles 1.
            <br/>
            The bottles 1 conveyed from the conveyor NT after
            <br/>
            a sorting area 25 come to the area of the horizontal
            <br/>
            movement bars 4 of the two movement devices D1 and D2
            <br/>
            that is pre-assembling devices where they are arranged,
            <br/>
            together with the pusher 23 in the predetermined
            <br/>
            configuration of the packs.
            <br/>
            Such pre-assembling operation is performed by
            <br/>
            three devices D1, D2 and D3 acting in conjunction with
            <br/>
            the pusher 23 and in synchrony with the feeding of the
            <br/>
            feeding conveyor belt NT. These three devices are
            <br/>
            composed of chains 5, possibly running along annular
            <br/>
            rigid guides parallel with each other and arranged at
            <br/>
            the sides of the conveyor belt NT. Said devices are
            <br/>
            driven by monitored electric motors M3, M4, and M5.
            <br/>
            These chains 5 are orthogonally fastened to horizontal
            <br/>
            bars 4 moving parallel to the surface of the feeding
            <br/>
            conveyor belt NT, which are in contact with
            <br/>
            generatrices of the bottles 1 to be arranged.
            <br/>
            The first device D1 acts for making the rows of
            <br/>
            bottles transversally parallel and for giving them to
            <br/>
            the second device D2 that, together with the pusher 23

            is provided the device for lifting the packs, that is
            <br/>
            the set of bottles intended to form the packs. Said
            <br/>
            device is composed of a flat rigid structure 20 on
            <br/>
            which cylindrical columnar rods 6 are perpendicularly
            <br/>
            fastened, whose length is slightly greater than the

            driven by two endless, closed toothed belts 15 to which
            <br/>
            the structure 20 is connected by means of side slides
            <br/>
            slidably engaged along the guides 14 and connected by
            <br/>
            brackets to the respective belt 15. Each one of such
            <br/>
            belts 15 is driven by a lower gear wheel 34, the two
            <br/>
            gear wheels being both driven by a shared monitored

            synchronized manner. The weight to be lifted therefore
            <br/>
            corresponds to the weight of two packs. At the second
            <br/>
            level L2 the bottles 1, resting on the two half-

            <br/>
            by two conventional strapping machines R1 and R2 whose
            <br/>
            arches are horizontally arranged.
            <br/>
            A strap 24 is applied at the lower half of the

            applied at the neck of the bottles 1 just under the
            <br/>
            extruded collar provided below the cap. During such
            <br/>
            strapping operations the bottles 1 are kept still, with
            <br/>
            a minimum clearance, by means of a box-like structure
            <br/>
            22 open at the top and at the bottom and arranged at a
            <br/>
            fixed level between said two horizontal straps 24.

            The plant of the present invention can be also
            <br/>
            used advantageously for strapping containers similar
            <br/>
            and/or equivalent to PET bottles (1) by replacing the

            half-surfaces P/2 of the second level L2 and third
            <br/>
            level 13 with grippers 32 with elastic jaws.
            <br/>
            The operation is substantially the same, except
            <br/>
            for the use of said grippers 32, whose jaws are shaped
            <br/>
            such to move the sections of the several containers 28

            A variant embodiment of the invention provides a
            <br/>
            plant according to what described above, wherein the
            <br/>
            tower lifting the groups of bottles from the lower
            <br/>
            level Li to the upper level L3 is replaced, at least
            <br/>
            partially, by an arm or transfer device of the type
            <br/>
            known under the name pick and play.
            <br/>
            Such solution avoids providing the supporting
            <br/>
            half-surfaces P/2 of level L2 of the first strapping
            <br/>
            station, and of the upper level L3 for the transfer to
            <br/>
            the second strapping station.

            A first variant provides the pick and play
            <br/>
            transfer device to pick the containers with a gripper
            <br/>
            in the first strapping station and to hold them in
            <br/>
            place in such station, than transferring them to the
            <br/>
            second strapping station, that is to the station
            <br/>
            applying the loose strap intended to form the carrying
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <br/>
            handle.
            <br/>
            A further variant provides the pick and play
            <br/>
            transfer device to directly pick the groups of
            <br/>
            containers at the exit of the conveyor
            <br/>
            grouping/assembling the groups of containers denoted by
            <br/>
            D2 when they are on the surface Pl.
            <br/>
            In this case the pick and play transfer device
            <br/>
            makes a path in two steps, a first step for placing and
            <br/>
            holding the bottle group in the first strapping station
            <br/>
            at level L2 and, after applying the straps, a second
            <br/>
            step for transferring the bottle group from the first
            <br/>
            to the second strapping station.
            <br/>
            As the pick and play transfer device it is
            <br/>
            possible to use any device of the robotic arm type or
            <br/>
            similar devices that is provided associated to the
            <br/>
            plant and configured and designed for carrying out the
            <br/>
            transfer and holding steps described above.
            <br/>
            Grasping grippers can be provided with at least
            <br/>
            two jaws each one cooperating with one of two opposite
            <br/>
            sides of the container group having a contact surface
            <br/>
            shaped in a manner corresponding to the area in contact
            <br/>
            with the peripheral containers of the container group.
            <br/>
            Grippers of such type can be made for example such as
            <br/>
            shown and described with reference to figure 7. Other
            <br/>
            types of grasping devices are possible and their
            <br/>
            configuration depends on the outer shape of the
            <br/>
            containers.
            <br/>
            Figure 11 shows a pack provided with a quincunx-
            <br/>
            preventing system, that is a pack where the containers
            <br/>
            are efficaciously prevented from taking a relative

            quincunx position. Such effect occurs above all for
            <br/>
            groups of containers having six or more containers and
            <br/>
            wherein the containers are placed on several rows
            <br/>
            and/or lines, the distance between two adjacent
            <br/>
            containers corresponding to a maximum diameter of said
            <br/>
            containers with reference to the central axis thereof.
            <br/>
            As an alternative to the application of glue
            <br/>
            between two containers of the central row of the group
            <br/>
            of six containers denoted by 1', the present embodiment
            <br/>
            in order to considerably restrain or prevent said
            <br/>
            containers from accomplishing a counter-rotation with
            <br/>
            respect to each other, provides said two containers 1,
            <br/>
            l' to be further bound together by a predetermined
            <br/>
            tightening force by a strap 124. The tightening force
            <br/>
            is calculated such to generate friction between the
            <br/>
            contact areas of the containers 1, 1' that considerably
            <br/>
            restrains or prevents them from counter-rotating. Such
            <br/>
            arrangement is functional to prevent the containers
            <br/>
            from passing from the aligned position to the quincunx
            <br/>
            position.
            <br/>
            With reference to the plant, such further strap
            <br/>
            connecting the two central containers occurs in a pre-
            <br/>
            strapping           station      provided       upstream         the
            <br/>
            grouping/assembling conveyor denoted by 25, D1 and D2
            <br/>
            in the figures.
            <br/>
            The pre-strapping station, not shown in details,
            <br/>
            can provide a pusher for two bottles in the feeding
            <br/>
            flow which are intended to take a central or
            <br/>
            intermediate position in the container group of the
            <br/>
            type similar to that operating for grouping and

            According to a further variant, when the container
            <br/>
            groups provide a higher number of rows, lines and
