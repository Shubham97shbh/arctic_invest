            <br/>
            Cross Reference to Related Application
            <br/>
            This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional
            <br/>
            Application
            <br/>
            No. 62/611,120, titled "CONVEYANCE MODELING," filed December 28, 2017, the
            <br/>
            entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
            <br/>
            Background of the Disclosure
            <br/>
            Drilling operations have become increasingly expensive as the need to drill
            <br/>
            deeper, in harsher environments, and through more difficult materials has
            <br/>
            become a
            <br/>
            reality. In addition, testing and evaluation of completed and partially
            <br/>
            finished wellbores
            <br/>
            has become commonplace, such as to increase well production and return on
            <br/>
            investment.
            <br/>
            Consequently, in working with deeper and more complex wellbores, it becomes
            <br/>
            more
            <br/>
            likely that tools, tool strings, and/or other downhole equipment may become
            <br/>
            stuck within
            <br/>
            the wellbore.
            <br/>
            A downhole tool, often referred to as a jarring tool, may be operable to
            <br/>
            dislodge
            <br/>
            the downhole equipment when it becomes stuck. The jarring tool may be included
            <br/>
            as part
            <br/>
            of the tool string and deployed downhole along with the downhole equipment, or
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            jarring tool may be deployed downhole to free the downhole equipment after it
            <br/>
            becomes
            <br/>
            stuck. Tension may be applied to the deployed tool string via a conveyance
            <br/>
            means to
            <br/>
            trigger the jarring tool and, thus, deliver an impact intended to dislodge the
            <br/>
            stuck
            <br/>
            downhole equipment.

            according
            <br/>
            to one or more aspects of the present disclosure. The wellsite system 100 may
            <br/>
            comprise a
            <br/>
            tool string 110 suspended within a wellbore 120 that extends from a wellsite
            <br/>
            surface 105
            <br/>
            into one or more subterranean formations 130. The wellbore 120 is depicted as
            <br/>
            being a
            <br/>
            cased-hole implementation comprising a casing 180 secured by cement 190.
            <br/>
            However,
            <br/>
            one or more aspects of the present disclosure are also applicable to and/or
            <br/>
            readily

            equipment
            <br/>
            175 disposed at the wellsite surface 105, including a power and control system
            <br/>

            <br/>
            tool string 110 may comprise a first portion 140, a second portion 150, and a
            <br/>
            jarring tool
            <br/>
            200 coupled between the first portion 140 and the second portion 150. The tool
            <br/>
            string
            <br/>
            110 may further comprise a sensor tool 500 coupled between the jarring tool
            <br/>
            200 and the
            <br/>
            second portion 150. However, as described below, the sensor tool 500 may be
            <br/>
            coupled at
            <br/>
            another location within the tool string 110, such as between the jarring tool
            <br/>
            200 and the
            <br/>
            first portion 140.
            <br/>
            The jarring tool 200 and the sensor tool 500 are each implemented as single
            <br/>
            downhole tools. In the context of the present disclosure, a "single downhole
            <br/>
            tool" may be
            <br/>
            that which includes no more than two interfaces that are capable of being
            <br/>
            operably
            <br/>
            coupled or "made-up" with other downhole tools to form the tool string 110.
            <br/>
            Thus,
            <br/>
            coupling the jarring tool 200 with the sensor tool 500 does not result in a
            <br/>
            "single
            <br/>
            downhole tool" because such assembly would have four interfaces that are
            <br/>
            capable of
            <br/>
            being coupled with other downhole tools to form the tool string 110 ¨ namely,
            <br/>
            the two
            <br/>
            interfaces of the jarring tool 200 and the two interfaces of the sensor tool
            <br/>
            500.
            <br/>
            Accordingly, assembling the jarring tool 200 with the sensor tool 500 results
            <br/>
            in two
            <br/>
            downhole tools instead of a "single downhole tool."

            equipment
            <br/>
            175, including the power and control system 172. The conveyance means 160 may

            The jarring tool 200 and/or associated apparatus may be operable to detect an
            <br/>
            electrical characteristic of the electrical conductor 205, impart a first
            <br/>
            impact force on the
            <br/>
            second portion 150 of the tool string 110 when the electrical characteristic
            <br/>
            is detected,
            <br/>
            and impart a second impact force on the second portion 150 of the tool string
            <br/>
            110 when
            <br/>
            the electrical characteristic is not detected. The second impact force may be
            <br/>
            substantially
            <br/>
            greater than or otherwise different from the first impact force. For example,
            <br/>
            the first
            <br/>
            impact force may be about 3,500 pounds (or about 15.6 kilonewtons), whereas
            <br/>
            the second
            <br/>
            impact force may be about 9,000 pounds (or about 40.0 kilonewtons). However,
            <br/>
            other
            <br/>
            quantities are also within the scope of the present disclosure. For example,

            <br/>
            impact force may range between about 1,000 pounds (or about 4.4 kilonewtons)
            <br/>
            and
            <br/>
            about 6,000 pounds (or about 26.7 kilonewtons), and the second impact force
            <br/>
            may range
            <br/>
            between about 6,000 pounds (or about 26.7 kilonewtons) and about 12,000 pounds
            <br/>
            (or
            <br/>
            about 53.4 kilonewtons). A difference between the first and second impact
            <br/>
            forces may
            <br/>
            range between about 1,000 pounds (or about 4.4 kilonewtons) and about 6,000
            <br/>
            pounds (or
            <br/>
            about 26.7 kilonewtons), although other differences are also within the scope
            <br/>
            of the
            <br/>
            present disclosure.
            <br/>
            The electrical characteristic detected by the jarring tool 200 may be a
            <br/>
            substantially
            <br/>
            non-zero voltage and/or current, such as in implementations in which the
            <br/>
            electrical
            <br/>
            characteristic is a voltage substantially greater than about 0.01 volts and/or
            <br/>
            a current
            <br/>
            substantially greater than about 0.001 amperes. For example, the electrical
            <br/>
            characteristic
            <br/>
            may be a voltage substantially greater than about 0.1 volts and/or a current
            <br/>
            substantially
            <br/>
            greater than about 0.01 amperes. However, other values are also within the
            <br/>
            scope of the
            <br/>
            present disclosure.

            The latching mechanism 240 may comprise a female latch portion 275, a male
            <br/>
            latch portion 280, and an anti-release member 285. The female latch portion
            <br/>
            275 may be
            <br/>
            slidably retained within the second upper housing portion 250 between a
            <br/>
            detector housing
            <br/>
            290 and at least a portion of an upper adjuster 295. A floating separator 305
            <br/>
            may be
            <br/>
            disposed between the female latch portion 275 and the detector housing 290. In
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            depicted implementation, the separator 305 is a Belleville washer retained
            <br/>
            between the
            <br/>
            female latch portion 275 and a lock ring 310. The lock ring 310 may be
            <br/>
            threadedly
            <br/>
            engaged with the detector housing 290 to retain mating engagement between
            <br/>
            corresponding conical or otherwise tapered mating surfaces 315 external to the
            <br/>
            detector
            <br/>
            housing 290 with corresponding conical or otherwise tapered mating surfaces
            <br/>
            317 internal
            <br/>
            to the first upper housing portion 245, thus positionally fixing the detector
            <br/>
            housing 290
            <br/>
            relative to the first upper housing portion 245.
            <br/>
            The male latch portion 280 comprises a plurality of flexible members 320
            <br/>
            collectively operable to detachably engage the female latch portion 275. While
            <br/>
            only two
            <br/>
            instances are visible in the figures, a person having ordinary skill in the
            <br/>
            art will readily
            <br/>
            recognize that more than two instances of the flexible member 320 collectively
            <br/>
            encircle
            <br/>
            the anti-release member 285. The male latch portion 280 is coupled to or
            <br/>
            otherwise
            <br/>
            carried with the shaft 270, such as via threaded means, fasteners, pins,
            <br/>
            press/interference
            <br/>
            fit, and/or other coupling 272. Thus, the female latch portion 275 is carried
            <br/>
            with and/or
            <br/>
            by the upper housing 242 and, thus, the first or upper portion 140 of the tool
            <br/>
            string 110,
            <br/>
            whereas the male latch portion 280 is carried with and/or by the lower housing
            <br/>
            265 and,
            <br/>
            thus, the sensor tool 500 and the second or lower portion 150 of the tool
            <br/>
            string 110. The
            <br/>
            detachable engagement between the female and male latch portions 275, 280 is
            <br/>
            between
            <br/>
            an internal profile 325 of the female latch portion 275 and an external
            <br/>
            profile 330 of each
            <br/>
            of the plurality of flexible members 320.
            <br/>
            The anti-release member 285 is moveable within the male latch portion 280
            <br/>
            between a first position, defining a first configuration of latching mechanism

            relative to the second upper housing portion 250, (2) the upper spring stack
            <br/>
            350 is
            <br/>
            operable to resist relative movement (and thus disengagement) of the female

            adjustment of the relative locations of the female latch portion 275 and the
            <br/>
            upper adjuster
            <br/>
            295 in response to relative rotation of the female latch portion 275 and the
            <br/>
            upper adjuster
            <br/>
            295, and (D) the second magnitude of the second impact force is adjustable in
            <br/>
            response to

            stack 355 relative
            <br/>
            to the second upper housing portion 250, which is accomplished by adjusting
            <br/>
            the location
            <br/>
            of the lower adjuster 340 via rotation relative to the second upper housing

            The detector housing 290 contains, for example, a detector 420 operable to
            <br/>
            detect
            <br/>
            the electrical characteristic based upon which the higher or lower impact
            <br/>
            force is imparted
            <br/>
            by the jarring tool 200 to the second tool string portion 150 (via the sensor
            <br/>
            tool 500). For
            <br/>
            example, as described above, the detector 420 may be operable to detect the
            <br/>
            presence of
            <br/>
            current and/or voltage on the electrical conductor 205, such as in
            <br/>
            implementations in
            <br/>
            which the detector is and/or comprises a transformer, a Hall effect sensor, a
            <br/>
            Faraday
            <br/>
            sensor, a magnetometer, and/or other devices operable in the detection of
            <br/>
            current and/or
            <br/>
            voltage. The detector 420 may be secured within the detector housing 290 by
            <br/>
            one or
            <br/>
            more threaded fasteners, pins, and/or other means 425.
            <br/>
            The detector 420 also is, comprises, and/or operates in conjunction with a
            <br/>
            solenoid, transducer, and/or other type of actuator operable to move the anti-
            <br/>
            release
            <br/>
            member 285 between the first position (shown in FIG. 2) and the second
            <br/>
            position (not
            <br/>
            shown), below the first position, based on whether the electrical
            <br/>
            characteristic sensor of
            <br/>
            the detector 420 detects the electrical characteristic. In the example
            <br/>
            implementation
            <br/>
            depicted in FIG. 2, such actuator comprises a plunger 430 extending from the
            <br/>
            detector
            <br/>
            420 and coupled to a mandrel 435 that slides axially with the plunger 430
            <br/>
            inside the
            <br/>
            detector housing 290. The plunger 430 and mandrel 435 may be coupled via one
            <br/>
            or more
            <br/>
            threaded fasteners, pins, and/or other means 440, which may slide within a
            <br/>
            slot 292
            <br/>
            extending through a sidewall of the detector housing 290. The mandrel 435
            <br/>
            includes a
            <br/>
            recess 445 within which a retaining ring and/or other means 455 retains a head
            <br/>
            450 of the
            <br/>
            anti-release member 285. A spring and/or other biasing member 460 disposed
            <br/>
            within the
            <br/>
            recess 445 urges the head 450 of the anti-release member 285 towards the
            <br/>
            retaining
            <br/>
            means 455 and/or otherwise resists upward movement of the anti-release member
            <br/>
            285
            <br/>
            relative to the mandrel 435.
            <br/>
            The detector housing 290 and the mandrel 435 may each comprise one or more
            <br/>
            passages 294 through which the electrical conductor 205 may pass and then
            <br/>
            extend
            <br/>
            through the anti-release member 285 and the shaft 270. Accordingly, the
            <br/>
            electrical
            <br/>
            conductor 205 may be in electrical communication with the electrical
            <br/>
            conductors 505,
            <br/>
            155 of the sensor tool 500 and the second tool string portion 150,
            <br/>
            respectively.
            <br/>
            The anti-release member 285 may comprise multiple sections of different
            <br/>
            diameters. For example, the head 450 of the anti-release member 285 may have a
            <br/>
            diameter sized for receipt within the recess 445 of the mandrel 435 and

            therein via the retaining means 455. For example, a blocking section 465 of
            <br/>
            the anti-
            <br/>
            release member 285 may have a diameter sized for receipt within the male latch
            <br/>
            portion
            <br/>
            280 (e.g., within the plurality of flexible members 320), such that the anti-
            <br/>
            release member
            <br/>
            285 prevents disengagement of the female and male latch portions 275, 280 when
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            blocking section 465 is positioned within the male latch portion 280. For
            <br/>
            example, the
            <br/>
            blocking section 465 of the anti-release member 285 may be sufficiently sized
            <br/>
            and/or
            <br/>
            otherwise configured such that, when positioned within the ends of the

            plurality of
            <br/>
            flexible members 320, the flexible members 320 are prevented from deflecting
            <br/>
            radially
            <br/>
            inward in response to contact between the inner profile 325 of the female
            <br/>
            latch portion
            <br/>
            275 and the outer profile 330 of each of the flexible members 320 of the male
            <br/>
            latch
            <br/>
            portion 280.

            The detector 420, the plunger 430, the mandrel 435, and the biasing member 460
            <br/>
            <br/>

            about
            <br/>
            0.2 inches (or about 0.8 centimeters) and about 2.0 inches (or about 5.1

            <br/>
            430, the mandrel 435, and/or the biasing member 460 may cooperatively

            about 0.8

            first

            <br/>
            During operation of the tool string 110, the tool string 110 with the jarring

            tool
            <br/>
            200 and the sensor tool 500 may be conveyed within the wellbore 120 that

            extends into
            <br/>
            the subterranean formation 130, as shown in FIG. 1. During such conveyance,
            <br/>
            the jarring
            <br/>
            tool 200 may be in the first configuration, as shown in FIG. 2, in which the
            <br/>
            detector 420
            <br/>
            is detecting an electrical characteristic (e.g., current and/or voltage) from
            <br/>
            the electrical
            <br/>
            conductor 205, such as may be received via electronic communication with
            <br/>
            surface
            <br/>
            equipment 175 via the electrical conductor 145 of the first tool string
            <br/>
            portion 140 and the
            <br/>
            conveyance means 160. However, the jarring tool 200 may also be in the second
            <br/>
            configuration described above (not shown), in which the detector 420 is not
            <br/>
            detecting the
            <br/>
            electrical characteristic (or is detecting the absence of the electrical
            <br/>
            characteristic) from
            <br/>
            the electrical conductor 205. The operation of the jarring tool 200 may
            <br/>
            comprise actively
            <br/>
            setting or adjusting the jarring tool 200 between the first and second
            <br/>
            configurations, such
            <br/>
            as by operating the surface equipment 175 to establish the electrical
            <br/>
            characteristic
            <br/>
            detectable by the detector 420. During subsequent operations, the second tool
            <br/>
            string
            <br/>
            portion 150 may become lodged or stuck in the wellbore 120. Consequently, the
            <br/>
            jarring
            <br/>
            tool 200 may perform a power stroke when the jarring tool 200 is in either the
            <br/>
            first or
            <br/>
            second configuration.
            <br/>
            During the power stroke, the tensioning device 170 of the surface equipment
            <br/>
            175
            <br/>
            is increasing the tension applied across the tool string 110 by pulling on the
            <br/>
            conveyance
            <br/>
            means 160. As the tension increases, the engagement between the female and
            <br/>
            male latch
            <br/>
            portions 275, 280 operates to overcome the biasing force of the upper and/or
            <br/>
            lower spring
            <br/>
            stacks 350, 355, thus causing the upper housing 242 to translate axially away
            <br/>
            from the
            <br/>
            lower housing 265. The tension is further increased in this manner by an
            <br/>
            amount
            <br/>
            sufficient for the blocking section 465 of the anti-release member 285 to
            <br/>
            emerge from
            <br/>
            within the ends of the flexible members 320 of the male latch portion 280,
            <br/>
            resulting in an

            As stated above, such impact may be initiated in the first or "low-force"
            <br/>
            configuration of the jarring tool 200, when the detector 240 is detecting the

            (or is
            <br/>
            detecting the absence of) the electrical characteristic. The resulting impact

            force is
            <br/>
            imparted to the lower tool string portion 150, such as along a load path

            265 and the
            <br/>
            housing 502 of the sensor tool 500.
            <br/>
            In the first or "low-force" jarring tool configuration, the detector 420, the
            <br/>
            plunger
            <br/>
            430, the mandrel 435, and/or the biasing member 460 may be collectively
            <br/>
            operated to
            <br/>
            move the blocking section 465 of the anti-release member 285 in the upward
            <br/>
            direction to
            <br/>
            decrease the distance 470 by which the upper and/or lower spring stacks 350,
            <br/>
            355 may be
            <br/>
            compressed for the flexible fingers 320 to deflect radially inward and

            disengage from the
            <br/>
            female latch portion 275. Consequently, the upper ends of the flexible members

            320 of
            <br/>
            the male latch portion 280 are able to deflect radially inward, thus
            <br/>
            permitting the
            <br/>
            disengagement of the female and male latch portions 275, 280, such that the
            <br/>
            upper
            <br/>
            housing 242 rapidly translates away from the lower housing 265 until one or

            the jarring tool 200 and the sensor tool 500 shown in one or more of FIGS. 1-
            <br/>
            4. Thus, the
            <br/>
            following description refers to FIGS. 1-5, collectively.
            <br/>
            The method 600 may comprise conveying 605 a tool string 110 comprising a
            <br/>
            jarring tool 200 and a sensor tool 500 within a wellbore 120 and applying 610
            <br/>
            tension to
            <br/>
            the tool string 110, ultimately including triggering 615 the jarring tool 200
            <br/>
            to impart an
            <br/>
            impact to the tool string 110. As described above, the jarring tool 200 may
            <br/>
            comprise a
            <br/>
            housing and a shaft 270. The housing may comprise an upper housing 242 and a
            <br/>
            lower
            <br/>
            housing 265 slidably connected by the shaft 270, and triggering 615 the
            <br/>
            jarring tool 200
            <br/>
            to impart an impact to the tool string 110 may comprise triggering the jarring
            <br/>
            tool 200
            <br/>
            such that the upper housing 242 rapidly moves in an upper direction relative
            <br/>
            to the lower
            <br/>
            housing 265 until the upper and lower housings 242, 265 collide, thus
            <br/>
            generating the
            <br/>
            impact imparted to the tool string 110.
            <br/>
            As described above, the sensor tool 500 may comprise one or more
            <br/>
            accelerometers 526, one or more environment sensors 560, 562, 564, 568, and a
            <br/>
            memory
            <br/>
            device 558. The method 600 also comprises detecting 620 acceleration during
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            impact, via the accelerometer(s) 526, and storing 625 impact acceleration data
            <br/>

            - 24 -
            <br/>
            by the accelerometer(s) 526 on the memory device 558. The detected 620 and
            <br/>
            stored 625
            <br/>
            data may also include data from one or more of the environment sensors 560,
            <br/>
            562, 564,
            <br/>
            568.
            <br/>
            The method 600 may further comprise connecting 630 the sensor tool 500 with
            <br/>
            the jarring tool 200 prior to conveying 605 the tool string 110 within the
            <br/>
            wellbore 120.
            <br/>
            For example, the lower mechanical fastening means 218 of the jarring tool 200
            <br/>
            may be
            <br/>
            connected to the upper mechanical fastening means 512 of the sensor tool 500,
            <br/>
            and the
            <br/>
            one or more lower electrical connectors 217 of the jarring tool 200 may be
            <br/>
            connected
            <br/>
            with the one or more upper electrical connectors 528 of the sensor tool 500.
            <br/>
            The one or
            <br/>
            more lower electrical connectors 217 of the jarring tool 200 may be connected
            <br/>
            with the
            <br/>
            one or more upper electrical connectors 528 of the sensor tool 500 prior to
            <br/>
            connecting the
            <br/>
            lower mechanical fastening means 218 of the jarring tool 200 to the upper
            <br/>
            mechanical
            <br/>
            fastening means 512 of the sensor tool 500, or connecting the lower mechanical
            <br/>
            fastening
            <br/>
            means 218 of the jarring tool 200 to the upper mechanical fastening means 512
            <br/>
            of the
            <br/>
            sensor tool 500 may simultaneously connect the one or more lower electrical
            <br/>
            connectors
            <br/>
            217 of the jarring tool 200 with the one or more upper electrical connectors
            <br/>
            528 of the
            <br/>
            sensor tool 500.
            <br/>
            The method may further comprise connecting 632 the connected 630 jarring and
            <br/>
            sensor tools 200, 500 into the tool string 110. For example, the upper
            <br/>
            mechanical
            <br/>
            fastening means 212 of the jarring tool 200 may be connected to a
            <br/>
            corresponding
            <br/>
            interface of the first portion 140 of the tool string 110, and the lower
            <br/>
            mechanical fastening
            <br/>
            means 514 of the sensor tool 500 may be connected to a corresponding interface
            <br/>
            of the
            <br/>
            second portion 150 of the tool string 110. Such connecting 632 would further
            <br/>
            comprise
            <br/>
            connecting the one or more upper electrical connectors 215 of the jarring tool
            <br/>
            200 with a
            <br/>
            .. corresponding lower electrical connector of the first portion 140 of the
            <br/>
            tool string 110,
            <br/>
            and connecting the one or more lower electrical connectors 546 of the sensor
            <br/>
            tool 500
            <br/>
            with a corresponding upper electrical connector of the second portion 150 of
            <br/>
            the tool
            <br/>
            string 110. As above, the electrical connection may be made before making the
            <br/>
            mechanical connection, or making the mechanical connection may simultaneously
            <br/>
            make
            <br/>
            the electrical connection.
            <br/>
            The method 600 may further comprise replacing 635 the battery pack 524 by
            <br/>
            disconnecting and removing the battery pack 524 from the chassis 520 and
            <br/>
            inserting and
            <br/>
            connecting a replacement battery pack 524 into the chassis 520. Such battery
            <br/>

            <br/>
            - 25 -
            <br/>
            replacement 635 would be performed prior to connecting 632 the connected 630
            <br/>
            jarring
            <br/>
            and sensor tools 200, 500 into the tool string 110.
            <br/>
            The method 600 may also comprise determining 640 whether the stuck portion of
            <br/>
            the tool string 110 has become dislodged or unstuck. If it is determined 640
            <br/>
            that the stuck
            <br/>
            portion of the tool string 110 has become dislodged, the method 600 may
            <br/>
            comprise
            <br/>
            retrieving 645 the tool string 110 to the wellsite surface 105. The method 600
            <br/>
            may then
            <br/>
            comprise electrically connecting 650 a surface memory device 177 with the
            <br/>
            sensor tool
            <br/>
            500, retrieving 655 the impact acceleration data from the downhole memory
            <br/>
            device 558,
            <br/>
            and storing 660 the impact acceleration data on the surface memory device 177.
            <br/>
            If it is determined 640 that the stuck portion of the tool string 110 has not
            <br/>
            become
            <br/>
            dislodged, the method 600 may comprise assessing 665 the risk of damage to the
            <br/>
            tool
            <br/>
            string 110 by impact acceleration forces, such as by comparing the
            <br/>
            acceleration caused by
            <br/>
            the impact to a predetermined level of acceleration that the tool string 110
            <br/>
            can
            <br/>
            operationally withstand. If it is determined 665 that the acceleration caused
            <br/>
            by the impact
            <br/>
            is at or near the predetermined level, the impact may be repeated by again
            <br/>
            applying 610
            <br/>
            the tension to the tool string 110, including ultimately triggering 615 the
            <br/>
            jarring tool again
            <br/>
            impart the impact to the tool string 110. However, if it is determined 665
            <br/>
            that the
            <br/>
            acceleration caused by the impact is substantially less than the predetermined
            <br/>
            level (e.g.,
            <br/>
            by at least about twenty percent), then a second tension that is greater than
            <br/>
            the first
            <br/>
            tension (e.g., by about ten percent) may be applied 670 to the tool string
            <br/>
            110, including
            <br/>
            ultimately triggering 675 the jarring tool to impart a second, greater impact
            <br/>
            to the tool
            <br/>
            string 110. In such instances, the method 600 may also comprises detecting 680
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            greater acceleration during the second, greater impact, via the
            <br/>
            accelerometer(s) 526, and
            <br/>
            storing 685 impact acceleration data generated by the accelerometer(s) 526 on
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            memory device 558. The detected 680 and stored 685 data may also include data
            <br/>
            from
            <br/>
            one or more of the environment sensors 560, 562, 564, 568.
            <br/>
            As described above, the tool string 110 may further comprise one or more
            <br/>
            electrical conductors 145, 205, 505, 155 extending between the jarring tool
            <br/>
            200, the
            <br/>
            sensor tool 500, and a wellsite surface 105. The method 600 may further
            <br/>
            comprise
            <br/>
            transmitting 690 the impact acceleration data from the sensor tool 500 to the

            <br/>
            surface 105 through the one or more electrical conductors 145, 205, 505, 155,
            <br/>
            and storing
            <br/>
            660 the acceleration data on the surface memory device 177, after one or more
            <br/>

            (e.g.,
            <br/>
            wireline, tractors, roller devices, standoffs, etc.) For example, the

            effects of
            <br/>
            distance and number of jarring events to become unstuck. However, other

            the
            <br/>
            accessed 810 past data. Accessing 815 the intermediary data may also or

            810/815 past/intermediary data. For example, the accessed 810/815
            <br/>
            past/intermediary
            <br/>

            The preprocessing may also or instead comprise downsampling. For example,

            such downsampling may comprise randomly or otherwise selecting a percentage of

            the

            noise
            <br/>
            from the accessed 810/815 past/intermediary data, and/or in detecting trends

            <br/>
            The preprocessing may also or instead comprise temporally aligning the data

            The method 800 includes accessing 830 actual job input data. The accessed 830

            job input data may include one or more of the inputs (e.g., inputs 720 in FIG.

            utilized with the

            generated 820 model to predict 840 job conveyance data. The predicted 840 job

            The generated 820 conveyance model may include different models utilized for

            utilized for

            different sections of the well.

            Generating 820 the conveyance model may include analytically identifying

            correlations between operational parameters available from previously analyzed

            conveyance operations represented by the accessed 810/815 past/intermediary
            <br/>
            data.
            <br/>
            Generating 820 the conveyance model may then include adjusting fitting

            parameters of

            first and second
            <br/>
            operational parameters in the accessed 810/815 past/intermediary data to

            optimize
            <br/>
            prediction performance of the conveyance model.
            <br/>
            For example, the accessed 810/815 past/intermediary data may be utilized to
            <br/>
            generate multiple feature-selection models, each predicting a corresponding
            <br/>
            one of the

            available operational parameters utilizing other ones of the available

            operational

            second
            <br/>
            operational parameters may then be selected based on the correlation exhibited
            <br/>
            by the

            assumptions based on human observations of prior operations in the field

            and then selecting which of the remaining operational parameters will be used
            <br/>
            for model
            <br/>
            inputs. Using each available input to model the predicted outputs is an
            <br/>
            option. However,
            <br/>
            it may be the case that just a few of the inputs contribute to the majority of
            <br/>
            the output
            <br/>
            variability. By removing data inputs that are unrelated and/or have small
            <br/>
            correlations to
            <br/>
            the desired output, modeling can be performed more quickly and more
            <br/>
            efficiently, and
            <br/>
            with less noise that may hinder the results of the analysis. Moreover, two or
            <br/>
            more inputs
            <br/>
            may be combined to create new parameters (e.g., intermediary data) that may
            <br/>
            improve
            <br/>
            results.

            <br/>
            the

            predictive conveyance model. Such processes may include statistical and/or

            physics-

            of the
            <br/>
            past/intermediary data and then provide a prediction for the output. Physics-

            based
            <br/>
            modeling may utilize traditional physics equations derived from first

            describe the behavior of a given system, and may provide insight into the

            physical
            <br/>
            behavior of the system and how that system is failing. However, in most
            <br/>
            complex
            <br/>
            systems with high dimensional data, first principle models have not been
            <br/>
            formulated, and
            <br/>
            determining the relationship between a given output and a large number of
            <br/>
            input
            <br/>

            compared to
            <br/>
            the accessed 810/815 past/intermediary data. Such methods may improve
            <br/>
            performance
            <br/>
            by finding correlations between the input data and a given output and then use
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            correlation strength to weight the input parameters. Generating 820 the
            <br/>
            conveyance
            <br/>
            model may also include normalizing the accessed 810/815 past/intermediary data
            <br/>
            along

            multiple dimensions to improve model performance.
            <br/>
            The method 800 may also include accessing 850 actual job conveyance data. The

            TD), such as for
            <br/>
            scenarios in which the depth is not attainable by gravity alone. The model may

            successfully utilized to pump the tool/toolstring to the desired depth (e.g.,
            <br/>
            TD), but
            <br/>
            without breaking the weak point / 50% breaking strength.
            <br/>
            One or more of such results may be output via a surface weight graph from
            <br/>
            surface to the desired depth (e.g., TD) for run in and pull out, perhaps
            <br/>
            including a hold-up
            <br/>
            line. The graph may also include a curve representing 50% of breaking
            <br/>
            strength, and/or a
            <br/>
            curve representing jar firing force. One or more of the results may also or
            <br/>
            instead be
            <br/>
            output via a cable head tension graph from surface to the desired depth (e.g.,
            <br/>
            TD) for run
            <br/>
            in and pull out. One or more of the results may also or instead be output via
            <br/>
            stretch
            <br/>
            profile from surface to the desired depth (e.g., TD) for run in and pull out.
            <br/>
            Such outputs
            <br/>
            may also be accompanied by a summary of the simulation/model inputs.
            <br/>
            The model may permit the user to vary tool/toolstring friction independent of
            <br/>
            well
            <br/>
            friction. The model may also or instead permit the user to vary wireline
            <br/>
            friction
            <br/>
            independent of the tool/toolstring and/or well friction. The model may also or
            <br/>
            instead
            <br/>
            permit the user to select the display (or otherwise output) comparative
            <br/>
            results for different
            <br/>
            inputs on the same graphical outputs (and/or other output types). The model
            <br/>
            may also or
            <br/>
            instead permit the user to enter multiple "permeable zone" depths and
            <br/>
            pressures, such as
            <br/>
            for open-hole scenarios. The model may also or instead permit the user to
            <br/>
            choose from a
            <br/>
            limited selection of fluids contained in the well, such as gas, oil, water,
            <br/>
            brine, oil- or
            <br/>
            water-based mud, fracturing fluid, workover fluid, and/or other examples.
            <br/>
            The model may be utilized by a human operator via one or more front end user
            <br/>
            interfaces permitting inputs as described above. Such inputs may include, for
            <br/>
            example:
            <br/>
            (1) well inputs, such as IDs at different depths, the well medium (perhaps
            <br/>
            including
            <br/>
            pressure and/or temperature at the top and/or bottom of the well), and/or well
            <br/>
            condition,
            <br/>
            among other examples; (2) tool/toolstring inputs, such as ODs, lengths,
            <br/>
            weights, friction
            <br/>
            reduction means, and/or centrality in the well, among other examples; and/or
            <br/>
            (3) wireline
            <br/>
            inputs, such as OD, weight in air, stretch, and/or breaking strength, among
            <br/>
            other
            <br/>
            examples. One or more of these and/or other example inputs may be entered each
            <br/>
            time
            <br/>
            the simulation is run, or may be obtained via libraries (and/or respective
            <br/>
            back end
            <br/>
            interfaces). The inputs may be recorded in a database for retrieval later,
            <br/>
            such as stored by
            <br/>
            job/project number, user identification, job/project name, secondary (e.g.,

            <br/>
            In the example depicted in FIGS. 9-12, the graph area 1000 is displaying
            <br/>
            surface
            <br/>
            weight versus depth. The curves include a curve 1002 depicting an initial set
            <br/>
            of inputs, a
            <br/>
            curve 1004 depicting a first modification of the inputs, and a curve 1006
            <br/>
            depicting a
            <br/>
            second modification of the inputs. Another curve 1008 represents stretch for
            <br/>
            RIH, while
            <br/>
            curve 1010 represents stretch for POOH. Another curve 1012 represents jar
            <br/>
            firing force.
            <br/>
            The output may be iterative, in that the user may adjust inputs to see changes
            <br/>
            in
            <br/>
            the results. Results may be automatically attached to the graph in their
            <br/>
            position until the
            <br/>
            user selects and deletes, so that a comparison can be seen between two options
            <br/>
            (toolstring
            <br/>
            types, conveyance assistance means, etc.). As inputs are changed and new
            <br/>
            results are
            <br/>
            added, the curve depicting the previous results line may change, such as in
            <br/>
            color,
            <br/>
            thickness, solid-dashed-dotted, etc.
            <br/>
            When a tractor is indicated in the toolstring, the force required to reach
            <br/>
            depth may
            <br/>
            automatically be obtained, and that force may be applied to a predetermined
            <br/>
            length of the
            <br/>
            well for RIH, such as from 30 meters before the holdup depth to TD. When a jar
            <br/>
            is
            <br/>
            indicated in the toolstring, optimum settings for the jar may automatically be
            <br/>
            obtained
            <br/>
            (e.g., based on spreadsheet calculation or otherwise) using inputs already
            <br/>
            available in the
            <br/>
            simulation, and the firing line may be automatically displayed on the surface
            <br/>
            weight
            <br/>
            graph, perhaps with +/- tolerances determined previously, by the model, and/or
            <br/>
            otherwise.
            <br/>
            TD may be assumed to be the end of the well. If the toolstring cannot reach
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            end of the well, TD may be automatically adjusted to hold-up depth, but may be
            <br/>
            reset
            <br/>
            anytime an input is changed.

            User inputs and selections from menus may be saved in a database for later
            <br/>
            retrieval and re-running of simulations. If the product is web-based, usemames
            <br/>
            (e. g. ,
            <br/>
            email) and/or passwords may be utilized for access and record-keeping
            <br/>
            purposes, as well
            <br/>
            as for personal or public library purposes. Each project may be saved in a
            <br/>
            common
            <br/>
            database against that usemame/password, and all users may be able to access
            <br/>
            all projects,
            <br/>
            well profiles, toolstring profiles, and wireline profiles added by other
            <br/>
            users, perhaps
            <br/>
            referenced by project name and/or creator ID.
            <br/>
            Given the above database functionality, a log-in screen will be used as a
            <br/>
            precursor
            <br/>
            to the user interface. After providing an approved usemame and/or password,
            <br/>
            the user
            <br/>
            may be asked to enter a name of their new project, or to select an existing
            <br/>
            project to
            <br/>
            retrieve from the database. If a previous project is selected and modified,
            <br/>
            the user may be
            <br/>
            asked to save or save-as upon closing the project.
            <br/>
            Implementations of the above example may also support multiphase scenarios,
            <br/>
            more or fully automated analysis, and/or other options not explicitly
            <br/>
            described above.
            <br/>
            The foregoing outlines features of several embodiments so that a person having
            <br/>
            ordinary skill in the art may better understand the aspects of the present
