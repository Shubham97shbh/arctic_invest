            DRY POWDER FORMULATIONS OF ALPHA-1 ANTITRYPSIN
            <br/>
            FIELD OF THE INVENTION
            <br/>
            The present invention relates to dry powder formulations of alpha-1 antitryp
            <br/>
            sin.
            <br/>
            In particular, the present invention relates to dry powder formulations having
            <br/>
            a high
            <br/>
            concentration of monomeric alpha-1 antitrypsin; and specific excipients, and
            <br/>
            methods of
            <br/>
            using same.
            <br/>
            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
            <br/>
            Numerous methods have been devised for delivering active ingredients into
            <br/>
            living
            <br/>
            organisms. Traditional oral therapeutic dosage forms include both solids
            <br/>
            (tablets,
            <br/>
            capsules, pills, etc.) and liquids (solutions, suspensions, emulsions, etc.).
            <br/>
            Parenteral
            <br/>
            dosage forms include solids and liquids as well as aerosols (administered by
            <br/>
            inhalers,
            <br/>
            etc.), injectables (administered with syringes, micro-needle arrays, etc.),
            <br/>
            topicals
            <br/>
            (foams, ointments, etc.), and suppositories, among other dosage forms. These
            <br/>
            dosage
            <br/>
            forms are more effective in delivering low molecular weight drugs, but are
            <br/>
            less effective
            <br/>
            with high molecular weight ingredients when controlling either the spatial or
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            temporal component of the active ingredient distribution is more difficult.
            <br/>
            Oral drug
            <br/>
            delivery is perhaps the most convenient method, but many drugs are degraded in
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            digestive tract before they can be absorbed. This is particularly true for bio-
            <br/>
            therapeutics,
            <br/>
            i.e. pharmaceutically active peptides (e.g. growth factors), proteins (e.g.
            <br/>
            enzymes,
            <br/>
            antibodies), oligonucleotides (e.g. RNA, DNA, PNA), hormones and other natural
            <br/>
            <br/>
            substances or similar synthetic substances. Intravenous infusion and
            <br/>
            subcutaneous
            <br/>
            injection is frequently an effective route for systemic drug delivery,
            <br/>
            including the
            <br/>
            delivery of proteins, but enjoys a low patient acceptance. Since the need to
            <br/>
            inject drugs
            <br/>
            on a frequent schedule, such as insulin one or more times a day, can be a
            <br/>
            source of poor
            <br/>
            patient compliance, a variety of alternative routes of administration have
            <br/>
            been
            <br/>
            developed, including transdermal, intranasal, intrarectal, intravaginal, and
            <br/>
            pulmonary
            <br/>
            delivery.
            <br/>
            Oral inhalation (pulmonary delivery) is a common method of drug delivery. The
            <br/>
            pulmonary drug dispersion compositions are designed to be delivered to the
            <br/>
            patient by
            <br/>
            inhalation so that the active ingredient can reach the different regions of
            <br/>
            the lungs.
            <br/>
            Pulmonary delivery is particularly useful for the delivery of macromolecules
            <br/>
            such as
            <br/>
            <br/>
            CA 03048150 2019-06-21
            <br/>
            WO 2018/116300
            <br/>

            <br/>
            2
            <br/>
            proteins which are difficult to be delivered to the lungs by other routes of
            <br/>
            administration. Such pulmonary delivery can be effective both for systemic
            <br/>
            delivery and
            <br/>
            for localized delivery to treat diseases of the lung.
            <br/>
            The ability to deliver pharmaceutical macromolecule compositions as dry
            <br/>
            powders is challenging in certain aspects. For example, the dosage of
            <br/>
            pharmaceutical
            <br/>
            compositions is often critical, so it is desirable that dry powder delivery
            <br/>
            systems be able
            <br/>
            to deliver an accurate and reliable intended amount of drug. In addition, many
            <br/>
            <br/>
            pharmaceutical compositions are quite expensive, necessitating maximum
            <br/>
            utilization.
            <br/>
            Thus, the ability to efficiently formulate, process, package, and deliver the
            <br/>
            dry powders
            <br/>
            with a minimal loss of drug is critical. Dry powder formulation of high
            <br/>
            molecular
            <br/>
            weight molecules, particularly proteins, pose the challenge of obtaining high
            <br/>
            amounts of
            <br/>
            the protein (in the range of tens milligram and not the typical range of
            <br/>
            micrograms) with
            <br/>
            very low excipient amount to maximize the protein content in each dosage form
            <br/>
            while
            <br/>
            keeping low water content and minimal percentage of protein aggregates.
            <br/>
            While the permeability of natural macromolecules in the lung is well known,
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            combined inefficiencies of macromolecule production processes and
            <br/>
            macromolecule
            <br/>
            delivery has limited commercialization of dry macromolecule powders for
            <br/>
            pulmonary
            <br/>
            delivery.
            <br/>
            The use of spray drying for the preparation of dry particles from liquid
            <br/>
            starting
            <br/>
            materials is a conventional process, but has usually been limited to small
            <br/>
            molecules and
            <br/>
            other stable materials that are less sensitive to thermal and other rigorous
            <br/>
            treatments.
            <br/>
            Macromolecule compositions, such as proteins are often labile and subject to
            <br/>
            degradation and/or aggregation during the spray drying process. For efficient
            <br/>
            and safe
            <br/>
            pulmonary delivery, it is desirable that the particles size be maintained
            <br/>
            below 5 [tm and
            <br/>
            in a highly homogeneous form. Larger particle sizes easily stick in the mouth
            <br/>
            and
            <br/>
            throat. In addition, it is necessary to obtain dry powder as pure as possible
            <br/>
            and in a
            <br/>
            useable form.
            <br/>
            Powders with a particle size suitable for inhalation have a tendency of
            <br/>
            aggregating. These aggregated forms need to be de-aggregated before entering
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            airways of the user. De-aggregation can be achieved by introducing energy e.g.
            <br/>
            electrical, mechanical, or aerodynamic energy. Various formulations and
            <br/>
            techniques are

            used to produce a uniformed and non aggregated powder. For example, there are
            <br/>
            techniques that include modification of the particles shape and surface
            <br/>
            properties e.g.
            <br/>
            controlled forming of powder pellets, as well as addition of inert carrier.
            <br/>
            The
            <br/>
            formulations usually contain high concentrations of excipients intended to
            <br/>
            stabilize and
            <br/>
            reduce the aggregation and degradation of the active agent.

            Alpha-1 Antitryp sin
            <br/>
            Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT), also known as Alpha- 1-Proteinase Inhibitor (API),
            <br/>
            is
            <br/>
            a plasma protein belonging to the family of serine proteinase inhibitors. The
            <br/>
            natural
            <br/>
            protein is a glycoprotein having an average molecular weight of 50,600
            <br/>
            daltons,
            <br/>
            produced primarily by the liver and secreted into the circulatory system. The
            <br/>
            protein is a
            <br/>
            single polypeptide chain, to which several oligosaccharide units are
            <br/>
            covalently bound in
            <br/>
            three N-glycosylation sites. AAT has a role in controlling tissue destruction
            <br/>
            by
            <br/>
            endogenous serine proteinases, and is the most prevalent serine proteinase
            <br/>
            inhibitor in
            <br/>
            blood plasma. AAT inhibits, inter alia, trypsin, chymotrypsin, various types
            <br/>
            of
            <br/>
            .. elastases, skin collagenase, renin, urokinase and proteases of
            <br/>
            polymorphonuclear
            <br/>
            lymphocytes.
            <br/>
            Plasma derived AAT (pAAT) is currently used therapeutically for the treatment
            <br/>
            of
            <br/>
            pulmonary emphysema in patients who have a genetic AAT deficiency, also known
            <br/>
            as
            <br/>
            Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency or Congenital Emphysema. Purified pAAT has been
            <br/>
            approved for replacement therapy (also known as "augmentation therapy") in
            <br/>
            these
            <br/>
            patients. There is a continuous effort targeted at producing recombinant AAT,
            <br/>
            but as of
            <br/>
            today there is no approved recombinant product. The endogenous role of AAT in
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            lungs is predominantly to regulate the activity of neutrophil elastase, which

            quantities of

            AAT, the elastase breaks down lung tissue, which over time results in chronic

            suffer from recurrent endobronchial infections and sinusitis. The major cause

            of
            <br/>
            morbidity and mortality among CF patients is lung diseases. CF patients carry

            a
            <br/>
            mutation in the CFTR gene, resulting in a malfunctioning CTFR protein,

            defective
            <br/>
            water and salt transport and the ensuing thick secretions in the lung.

            The membrane defect caused by the CFTR mutation leads to chronic lung
            <br/>
            inflammation and infection. In normal individuals, elastase secreted by
            <br/>
            neutrophils in
            <br/>
            response to infection is neutralized by AAT. AAT is known to penetrate into
            <br/>
            pulmonary
            <br/>
            tissue and exert its activity within this tissue. In patients with CF,
            <br/>
            however, the
            <br/>
            unregulated inflammatory response overwhelms the normal protease
            <br/>
            (elastase)/antiprotease (AAT) balance. The abnormal cycle is destructively
            <br/>
            self-
            <br/>
            perpetuating and leads to the accumulation of elastase in the lung and
            <br/>
            ultimately to
            <br/>
            tissue damage, destruction of the lung architecture, severe pulmonary
            <br/>
            dysfunction and,
            <br/>
            ultimately, death. Supplemental AAT may reduce the deleterious effects

            associated with
            <br/>
            excessive amounts of elastase.

            DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
            <br/>
            The present invention is directed, inter alia, to dry powder compositions of
            <br/>
            AAT.
            <br/>
            The dry powder compositions preserve the AAT molecules in their monomeric form
            <br/>
            <br/>
            and exhibit high stability. Unexpectedly, a combination of high concentrations
            <br/>
            of AAT
            <br/>
            with specific excipients such as Trehalose, Glycine and DPPC, exhibits
            <br/>
            superior
            <br/>
            properties, making it suitable for pulmonary administration. It is to be
            <br/>
            particularly
            <br/>
            understood that while the dry powder compositions of the present invention are
            <br/>
            intended primarily for pulmonary administration, other AAT dry-powder
            <br/>
            formulation
            <br/>
            are also encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
            <br/>
            As used herein, the term "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin" (AAT) refers to a glycoprotein
            <br/>
            which is naturally produced by the liver and secreted into the circulatory
            <br/>
            system. AAT
            <br/>
            belongs to the Serine Proteinase Inhibitor (Serpin) family of proteolytic
            <br/>
            inhibitors. This
            <br/>
            glycoprotein consists of a single polypeptide chain containing one cysteine
            <br/>
            residue and
            <br/>
            12-13% of the total molecular weight of carbohydrates. AAT has three N-
            <br/>
            glycosylation
            <br/>
            sites at asparagine residues 46, 83 and 247, which are occupied by mixtures of
            <br/>
            complex
            <br/>
            bi- and triantennary glycans. This gives rise to multiple AAT isoforms, having
            <br/>
            <br/>
            isoelectric point in the range of 4.0 to 5Ø The glycan monosaccharides
            <br/>
            include N-
            <br/>
            acetylglucosamine, mannose, galactose, fucose and sialic acid. AAT serves as a
            <br/>
            pseudo-
            <br/>
            substrate for elastase; elastase attacks the reactive center loop of the AAT
            <br/>
            molecule by
            <br/>
            cleaving the bond between methionine358-serine359 residues to form an AAT-
            <br/>
            elastase
            <br/>
            complex. This complex is rapidly removed from the blood circulation. AAT is
            <br/>
            also
            <br/>
            referred to as "alpha-1 Proteinase Inhibitor" (API). The term "glycoprotein"
            <br/>
            as used
            <br/>
            herein refers to a protein or peptide covalently linked to a carbohydrate. The
            <br/>
            carbohydrate may be monomeric or composed of oligosaccharides.
            <br/>

            <br/>
            The AAT can be of a variety of different forms, including purified naturally
            <br/>
            occurring AAT and a recombinant AAT.
            <br/>
            The term "dry powder" refers to a powder composition that contains finely
            <br/>
            dispersed dry particles that are capable of being dispersed in an inhalation
            <br/>
            device and
            <br/>
            5    subsequently inhaled by a subject.
            <br/>
            The particles of the dry powder composition have particle size distribution
            <br/>
            that
            <br/>
            enables the particles to target the alveolar region of the lung when delivered
            <br/>
            via
            <br/>
            inhalation. The particle-size distribution (PSD) of a powder is a list of
            <br/>
            values or a
            <br/>
            mathematical function that defines the relative amount of particles present
            <br/>
            according to
            <br/>
            10                                                                     size.
            <br/>
            The powders of the invention are generally polydispersed (i.e., consist of a
            <br/>
            range
            <br/>
            of particle sizes). In particular embodiments, the term "particle size
            <br/>
            distribution" refers
            <br/>
            to the size distribution of particle system and represents the number of solid
            <br/>
            particles
            <br/>
            that fall into each of the various size ranges, given as a percentage of the
            <br/>
            total solids of
            <br/>
            all sizes in the sample of interest.
            <br/>
            As used herein, the term "particle size distribution D90 value" is defined as
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            numerical value, expressed in microns, at which 90 percent of the particles
            <br/>
            have particle
            <br/>
            sizes which are less than or equal to that value. As used herein, the term
            <br/>
            "particle size
            <br/>
            distribution D50 value" is defined as the numerical value, expressed in
            <br/>
            microns, at which
            <br/>
            50 percent of the particles have particle sizes which are less than or equal
            <br/>
            to that value.
            <br/>
            According to some embodiments, the average particle size is below 10 [tm. In
            <br/>
            other embodiments, the average particle size is below 9, 8, or 7 [tm. Each
            <br/>
            possibility
            <br/>
            represents a separate embodiment of the invention. In additional embodiments,
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            average particle size is between 1 to10 [tm, 2 to 9 [tm, 3 to 8 [tm, 4 to 8
            <br/>
            [tm, or 4-8 [tm.
            <br/>
            Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the invention. The
            <br/>
            average particle
            <br/>
            size of the powder may be measured as mass mean diameter (MMD) by conventional
            <br/>
            techniques.
            <br/>
            The term "dry" means that the particles of the powder have moisture content
            <br/>
            such
            <br/>
            that the powder is physically and chemically stable in storage at room
            <br/>
            temperature.
            <br/>
            According to some embodiments, the moisture content of the particles is below
            <br/>
            10%,
            <br/>
            8%, 6%, 4%, 2% or 1% by weight. Each possibility represents a separate

            <br/>
            A dry powder that is "suitable for pulmonary delivery" refers to a composition
            <br/>
            <br/>
            comprising solid or partially solid particles that are capable of being (i)
            <br/>
            readily
            <br/>
            dispersed by an inhalation device and (ii) inhaled by a subject so that a
            <br/>
            portion of the
            <br/>
            particles reach the lungs to permit penetration into the alveoli. Such a
            <br/>
            powder is
            <br/>
            considered to be "respirable".
            <br/>
            The dry powder composition may be incorporated into unit dosage form within an
            <br/>
            <br/>
            inhalation device. The amount depends on various factors and can be determined
            <br/>
            <br/>
            according to, without limiting, the disease to be treated, the target
            <br/>
            population, and
            <br/>
            inhalation device.
            <br/>
            The term "Emitted dose" is an indication of the delivery of a drug formulation
            <br/>
            from a specific inhaler device after a dispersion event. More specifically,
            <br/>
            emitted dose
            <br/>
            is a measure of the percentage of powder which exits from a unit dose package.
            <br/>
            A "dispersible" or "dispersive" powder is one having an emitted dose value of
            <br/>
            at
            <br/>
            least 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, or 90%. Each possibility represents a separate
            <br/>
            embodiment of the invention.
            <br/>
            Because the powders are dispersible, it is highly preferred that they be
            <br/>
            manufactured in a unit dosage form in a manner that allows for ready
            <br/>
            manipulation by
            <br/>
            the formulator and by the consumer. According to some embodiments, the unit
            <br/>

            the AAT is in its monomeric form. The-AAT-comprising dry powder of the
            <br/>
            invention is
            <br/>
            advantageous over hitherto known dry powder compositions comprising
            <br/>
            proteinaceus
            <br/>
            macromolecules, particularly AAT in that the AAT is in its active monomer form
            <br/>
            and in
            <br/>
            that the total amount of the composition to be inhaled is close to the

            <br/>
            <br/>
            95% by weight of the dry powder.
            <br/>
            The powders of the invention may further be characterized by their densities.
            <br/>
            According to some embodiments, the dry powder comprises particles having a
            <br/>
            bulk
            <br/>
            density from 0.1 to 10 grams per cubic centimeter. According to certain
            <br/>
            embodiments,
            <br/>
            the dry powder comprises particles having a bulk density from 0.1 to 2 grams
            <br/>
            per cubic
            <br/>
            centimeter. According to additional embodiments, the dry powder comprises
            <br/>
            particles
            <br/>
            having a bulk density from 0.15 to 1.5 grams per cubic centimeter.
            <br/>
            An additional measure for characterizing the dry powder is the none monomeric
            <br/>
            forms percent (NMF%), which implies for the aggregation level of the powder
            <br/>
            after
            <br/>
            reconstitution as measured by SEC-HPLC. According to some embodiments, the
            <br/>
            NMF% of the reconstituted powder is less than 8%. According to certain
            <br/>
            embodiments,
            <br/>
            the NMF% of the reconstituted powder is less than 7%. According to additional
            <br/>
            embodiments, the NMF% of the reconstituted powder is less than 6%.

            <br/>
            time. Generally,
            <br/>
            with respect to chemical stability, the AAT contained in the formulation will
            <br/>
            degrade by
            <br/>
            no more than about 10% over a time course of three months, preferably by no
            <br/>
            more than
            <br/>
            about 7%, and more preferably by no more than 5%, upon storage of the
            <br/>

            Utilizing the spray-dried approach, the AAT is first dissolved in water,
            <br/>
            optionally
            <br/>
            containing a physiologically acceptable buffer. According to certain exemplary
            <br/>
            <br/>
            embodiments, the AAT is in a form of a ready-to-use sterile solution produced
            <br/>
            essentially according to the teachings of U.S. Patent No. 7,879,800. The pH
            <br/>
            range of
            <br/>
            15    active agent-containing solutions is generally between about 4 and 11,
            <br/>
            with nearer
            <br/>
            neutral pHs being preferred, since such pHs may aid in maintaining the
            <br/>
            physiological
            <br/>
            compatibility of the powder after dissolution of powder within the lung. The
            <br/>
            aqueous
            <br/>
            formulation may optionally contain additional water-miscible solvents, such as
            <br/>
            acetone,
            <br/>
            alcohols and the like. Representative alcohols are lower alcohols such as
            <br/>
            methanol,
            <br/>
            ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, and the like. The pre-spray dried solutions
            <br/>
            will generally
            <br/>
            contain solids dissolved at a concentration from 0.01% (weight/volume) to
            <br/>
            about 40%
            <br/>
            (weight/volume), usually from 0.1% to 20% (weight/volume).
            <br/>
            The solutions are then spray dried in a conventional spray drier, such as
            <br/>
            those
            <br/>
            available from commercial suppliers such as Niro A/S (Denmark), Buchi
            <br/>
            (Switzerland),
            <br/>
            Eurotherm (US) and the like, resulting in a dispersible, dry powder. Optimal
            <br/>
            conditions
            <br/>
            for spray drying the solutions will vary depending upon the formulation
            <br/>
            components,
            <br/>
            and are generally determined experimentally. The gas used to spray dry the
            <br/>
            material is
            <br/>
            typically air, although inert gases such as nitrogen or argon are also
            <br/>
            suitable. Moreover,
            <br/>
            the temperature of both the inlet and outlet of the gas used to dry the
            <br/>
            sprayed material is
            <br/>
            such that it does not cause decomposition of the active agent in the sprayed
            <br/>
            material.
            <br/>
            Such temperatures are typically determined experimentally, although generally,
            <br/>
            the inlet
            <br/>

            <br/>
            temperature
            <br/>
            will range from about 30 C to about 150 C.

            Alternatively, the composition may be prepared by spray-drying a suspension,
            <br/>
            as
            <br/>
            described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,976,574. In this method, the drug is dissolved in
            <br/>
            an organic
            <br/>
            solvent, e.g., methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, heptane, hexane
            <br/>
            chloroform,
            <br/>
            ether, followed by suspension of the hydrophilic excipient in the organic
            <br/>
            solvent to form
            <br/>
            a suspension. The suspension is then spray-dried to form particles. Exemplary
            <br/>
            solvents,
            <br/>
            for both of the above spray-drying methods include alcohols, ethers, ketones,
            <br/>
            hydrocarbons, polar aprotic solvents, and mixtures thereof.
            <br/>
            The dry powders of the invention may also be prepared by combining aqueous
            <br/>
            solutions or suspensions of the formulation components and spray-drying them
            <br/>
            simultaneously in a spray-dryer, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,001,336.
            <br/>
            Alternatively, powders may be prepared by lyophilization, vacuum drying, spray
            <br/>
            <br/>
            freeze drying, super critical fluid processing, air drying, or other forms of
            <br/>
            evaporative
            <br/>
            drying. According to certain preferred embodiments the dry powder formulation
            <br/>
            is
            <br/>
            provided in a form that possesses improved handling/processing
            <br/>
            characteristics, e.g.,
            <br/>
            reduced static, better flowability, low caking, and the like, by preparing
            <br/>
            compositions
            <br/>
            composed of fine particle aggregates, that is, aggregates or agglomerates of
            <br/>
            the above-
            <br/>
            described dry powder particles, where the aggregates are readily broken back
            <br/>
            down to
            <br/>
            the fine powder components for pulmonary delivery, as described, e.g., in U.S.
            <br/>
            Pat. No.
            <br/>
            5,654,007.
            <br/>
            Dry powders may also be prepared by agglomerating the powder components,
            <br/>
            sieving the materials to obtain agglomerates, spheronizing to provide a more
            <br/>
            spherical
            <br/>
            agglomerate, and sizing to obtain a uniformly-sized product, as described,
            <br/>
            e.g., in WO
            <br/>
            95/09616.
            <br/>
            Dry powders may also be manufactured by additional processes well known in the
            <br/>
            <br/>
            art, e.g. by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, grinding,
            <br/>
            pulverizing, dragee-making, levigating or lyophilizing processes.
            <br/>
            Once formed, the dry powder compositions are preferably maintained under dry
            <br/>
            (i.e., relatively low humidity) conditions during manufacture, processing, and
            <br/>
            storage.
            <br/>
            Irrespective of the drying process employed, the process will preferably
            <br/>
            result in

            Uses of the dry powder
            <br/>
            The dry powder composition may be delivered using any suitable dry powder
            <br/>
            inhaler (DPI). When administered using a DPI device, the powder is contained
            <br/>
            in a
            <br/>
            receptacle having a puncturable lid or other access surface, where the
            <br/>
            receptable may
            <br/>
            contain a single dosage unit or multiple dosage units. Convenient methods for
            <br/>
            filling

            large numbers of cavities (i.e., unit dose packages) with metered doses of dry
            <br/>
            powder
            <br/>
            medicament are described, e.g., in WO 97/41031.

            Prior to use, dry powders are generally stored under ambient conditions, and
            <br/>
            preferably are stored at temperatures at or below about 25 C., and relative
            <br/>
            humidities
            <br/>
            (RH) ranging from about 30 to 60%. More preferred relative humidity

            AAT deficiency is a genetic condition that increases the risk of developing a
            <br/>
            variety of diseases including pulmonary emphysema (Laurell and Eriksson, Scand
            <br/>
            J
            <br/>
            Clin lab Inves, 1963. 15:132-140). It is caused by mutations in the AAT
            <br/>
            encoding gene
            <br/>
            (proteinase inhibitor (Pi) gene). Over 100 different allelic variants of the
            <br/>
            Pi genotype are
            <br/>
            recognized, of which 34 were found to be associated with a quantitative or
            <br/>
            functional
            <br/>
            deficiency of circulating AAT.
            <br/>
            According to some embodiments, the dry powder composition is for use in
            <br/>
            treating Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD). A chronic obstructive
            <br/>
            pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease state characterized by airflow
            <br/>
            limitation that is
            <br/>
            not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and
            <br/>
            associated with an
            <br/>
            abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles or gases.
            <br/>
            Symptoms,
            <br/>
            functional abnormalities and complications of COPD can be attributed to this
            <br/>
            underlying phenomenon of abnormal inflammatory response and to processes
            <br/>
            related
            <br/>
            thereto.
            <br/>
            The compositions of the invention may be further used for treating additional
            <br/>
            diseases or conditions that would benefit from AAT treatment e.g. diseases
            <br/>
            associated
            <br/>
            with overexpression of proteases that are inhibited by AAT. For example,
            <br/>
            overexpression or excessive activity of elastase may be treated with AAT.
            <br/>
            AAT in aerosolized route may also be used as a treatment for cystic fibrosis
            <br/>
            (CF)
            <br/>
            patients who suffer from recurrent endobronchial infections and sinusitis. The
            <br/>
            major
            <br/>
            cause of morbidity and mortality among CF patients is lung diseases. CF
            <br/>
            patients carry
            <br/>
            a mutation in the CFTR gene, resulting in a malfunctioning CTFR protein,
            <br/>
            defective
            <br/>
            water and salt transport and the ensuing thick secretions in the lung. The
            <br/>
            membrane
            <br/>
            defect caused by the CFTR mutation leads to chronic lung inflammation and
            <br/>
            infection.
            <br/>
            In normal individuals, elastase secreted by neutrophils in response to
            <br/>
            infection is
            <br/>
            neutralized by AAT. AAT is known to penetrate into pulmonary tissue and exert
            <br/>
            its
            <br/>
            activity within this tissue. In patients with CF, however, the unregulated
            <br/>
            inflammatory
            <br/>
            response overwhelms the normal protease (elastase)/antiproteinase (AAT)
            <br/>
            balance. The
            <br/>
            abnormal cycle is destructively self-perpetuating and leads to the
            <br/>
            accumulation of
            <br/>
            elastase in the lung and ultimately to tissue damage, destruction of the lung
            <br/>
            architecture,
            <br/>
            severe pulmonary dysfunction and, ultimately, death. Supplemental AAT may
            <br/>
            reduce

            <br/>
            been shown
            <br/>
            that inhalation of AAT by CF patients increased the AAT levels and decreased
            <br/>
            elastase
            <br/>
            activity levels, neutrophils, pro-inflammatory cytokines and numbers of

            Pseudomonas;
            <br/>
            in this study, however no effect on AAT lung function was observed (Matthias

            <br/>
            The frequency of AAT treatment and the duration of each inhalation depends
            <br/>
            both
            <br/>
            on characteristics of the treated individual (age, weight, etc.) as well as on

            the
            <br/>
            characteristics of the pulmonary disease to be treated. According to certain
            <br/>
            embodiments, the duration of each inhalation is the duration of a single
            <br/>
            breath-taking,

            typically 1-2 seconds.

            The dry powder may be used for treating exacerbation episodes of pulmonary
            <br/>
            diseases.
            <br/>
            As used herein, the term "exacerbation" describes an increase in the severity
            <br/>
            of
            <br/>
            symptoms, which is mostly associated with a worsening of quality of life.
            <br/>
            Exacerbations
            <br/>
            are quite frequent in patients with chronic lung diseases in general and in
            <br/>
            AAT deficient
            <br/>
            patients in particular.
            <br/>
            The pathology and pathophysiology of exacerbations are different from those
            <br/>
            resulting from the regular course of the disease. Pathology of exacerbation is
            <br/>
            based on
            <br/>
            sputum analysis and the pathophysiology is based on gas exchange measurements
            <br/>
            (see,
            <br/>
            e.g., GOLD global strategy for diagnosis, management, and prevention of
            <br/>
            chronic
            <br/>
            obstructive pulmonary disease, updated 2004). Symptom based definition of an
            <br/>
            exacerbation is made by measuring deterioration from baseline for at least 2
            <br/>
            days of one
            <br/>
            or more of three major symptoms: dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum color
            <br/>
            (see, e.g.,
            <br/>
            Anthonisen NR, et al. Antibiotic therapy in exacerbations of chronic
            <br/>
            obstructive
            <br/>
            pulmonary disease. Ann Intern Med 1987; 106: 196-204).
            <br/>
            Additional or alternative common way for defining exacerbations is "event
            <br/>
            based"
            <br/>
            method. In this method, occurrence of exacerbation event and its severity is
            <br/>
            categorized
            <br/>
            by change in concomitant medications/change in therapy. Treatment may include
            <br/>
            increased doses of long-acting (3-2 adrenergic agonist inhalers, antibiotic
            <br/>
            agents,
            <br/>
            systemic corticosteroids, hospitalization, or combination thereof. This
            <br/>
            treatment change
            <br/>

            According to certain embodiments, the treatment is administered at least once
            <br/>
            a
            <br/>
            week during an exacerbation. According to yet further embodiments, the
            <br/>
            treatment is
            <br/>
            administered at least twice a week, preferably at least once a day, more

            5    least twice a day during an exacerbation episode.
            <br/>
            According to certain embodiments, administering AAT is performed in
            <br/>
            combination with at least one additional therapy. According to some
            <br/>
            embodiments, the
            <br/>
            additional therapy is selected from the group consisting of antibiotic
            <br/>
            therapy,

            10    therapy. According to other embodiments, the additional therapy is
            <br/>
            intravenous
            <br/>
            administration of AAT.

            <br/>
            1. AAT was concentrated to 126 mg/ml by ultra-filtration (UF) system and sent
            <br/>
            to
            <br/>
            Pharmaterials, UK to assess spray drying of AAT formulations.
            <br/>
            2. 24ml of 126mg/m1 AAT solution was diluted in DI-water to 300m1 to achieve

            It can be seen that AAT does not dry adequately without excipients and this
            <br/>
            could
            <br/>
            affect the aerosol performance of the powders.
            <br/>
            To further characterize the dry powder a Raman Spectroscopy assay was
            <br/>
            performed for spray dried formulations at T=0 and T=1 (40 C/ 75% RH). AAT was
            <br/>
            not
            <br/>
            affected by spray drying process (data not shown). However, a spectrum from
            <br/>
            the
            <br/>
            formulation containing DPPC only as excipient suggests some interaction
            <br/>
            between AAT
            <br/>
            and DPPC.
            <br/>
            Most of the formulations maintained the same spectra after 1 month storage at
            <br/>
            40 C/ 75% RH. The AAT-Lactose spectra demonstrate significant changes from T=
            <br/>
            0
            <br/>
            data and this indicates that AAT may be degraded in this formulation.
            <br/>
            Next, the particles size of the dry powder was evaluated.

            The results suggest that large particles with low density were formed when
            <br/>
            DPPC
            <br/>
            was used as excipient and small dense particles were formed when other
            <br/>
            excipients
            <br/>
            were used. Formulations containing DPPC occupied more volume and this suggests
            <br/>
            <br/>
            that particles with low density were produced. This phenomenon can lead to
            <br/>
            high
            <br/>
            aerosol performance of the powder as it affects the aerodynamic mass diameter

            of the
            <br/>
            particles so that even large, less dense particles, can reach the small

            airways of the lung.

            Results after 1 month    storage at 40 C/ 75% RH showed that the formulations

            The BAL study groups (3 rats for each treatment) were sacrificed and the lungs
            <br/>
            were collected for Broncho-alveolar Lavage (BAL). The BAL samples were
            <br/>
            analyzed
            <br/>
            for AAT and Urea concentrations (the urea was used as a normalization factor
            <br/>
            due to a
            <br/>
            different lavage volume). In parallel the AAT and the urea concentration were
            <br/>
            determined in the blood.
            <br/>
            The toxicokinetic study groups (3 rats per each treatment) were tested for AAT
            <br/>
            concentrations in the blood at several time points after the first
            <br/>
            administration: 0, 2, 4, 8,
            <br/>
            24 and 48 hours. In addition two additional bleeding points were added for the
            <br/>
            <br/>
            assessment of AAT accumulation in the blood.
            <br/>
            Toxicokinetic parameters were estimated using Phoenix pharmacokinetic
            <br/>
            software.

            All the rats have survived the four consecutive administrations of powder AAT
            <br/>
            over 7 days and no major pathological changes were observed. The lung weight,
            <br/>
            relatively to the body weight remained as in the control group (Table 9)
