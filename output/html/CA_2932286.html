            <br/>
            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
            <br/>
            [0003]    There are many commercially available website building systems and
            <br/>
            other interactive
            <br/>
            application building tools that can be used to create and edit websites and
            <br/>
            other on-line
            <br/>
            applications. End users can access such websites using client software on a
            <br/>
            variety of different
            <br/>
            platforms such as regular personal computers, smart-phones, tablets and other
            <br/>
            desktop or mobile
            <br/>
            devices.
            <br/>
            [0004]    These website building systems can come in different configurations
            <br/>
            such as fully on-
            <br/>
            line website building systems which are hosted on a server or servers
            <br/>
            connected to the internet
            <br/>
            and which are accessed using internet communication protocols such as
            <br/>
            hypertext transfer
            <br/>
            protocol (HTTP). The creation, editing and deployment of these website
            <br/>
            building systems are all
            <br/>
            performed on-line working directly with the servers.
            <br/>
            [0005]    Website building systems can also be partially online or sometimes
            <br/>
            even fully offline.
            <br/>
            For a partially online system, the website editing is performed locally on the
            <br/>
            user's machine and
            <br/>
            <br/>
            CA 02932286 2016-05-31
            <br/>
            WO 2015/083115                                            PCT/1B2014/066589
            <br/>
            is later uploaded to a central server or servers for deployment. Once
            <br/>
            uploaded, these website
            <br/>
            building systems behave in the same way as the full on-line website building
            <br/>
            systems.
            <br/>
            [0006]    Web site building systems have internal data architecture in order
            <br/>
            to organize data and
            <br/>
            elements within the system. This architecture may be different from the
            <br/>
            external view of the site
            <br/>
            in question as seen by the user and may also differ from the way typical
            <br/>
            hypertext markup
            <br/>
            language (HTML) pages are sent to the browser. For example, the internal data
            <br/>
            architecture can
            <br/>
            contain additional properties for each element on the page (creator, creation
            <br/>
            time, access
            <br/>
            permissions, links to templates etc.) which are essential for editing and
            <br/>
            maintaining the site
            <br/>
            within the website building system, but are not externally visible to the end-
            <br/>
            user (or even to
            <br/>
            some editing users). A typical architecture for a website building system
            <br/>
            based site may consist
            <br/>
            of pages containing components (e.g. shape components, picture components,
            <br/>
            text components,
            <br/>
            single- and multi-page containers containing mini-pages, etc.)
            <br/>
            [0007]    Components may be content-less such as a star-shape which does not
            <br/>
            have any
            <br/>
            internal content (through it has color, size, position and some other
            <br/>
            attributes) or may have
            <br/>
            internal content, such as a text paragraph component, whose internal content
            <br/>
            includes the
            <br/>
            displayed text, as well as font, formatting and layout information. This
            <br/>
            content may, of course,
            <br/>
            vary from one instance of the text paragraph component to another.
            <br/>
            [0008]    A designer using such a website building system may design a new
            <br/>
            creation from
            <br/>
            scratch (starting with a blank screen), or may rely on predefined application
            <br/>
            templates created
            <br/>
            by the designer himself or herself, by the system creator, or by the designer
            <br/>
            community. The
            <br/>
            website building system may support templates which are mere component
            <br/>
            collections,
            <br/>
            complete pages (or mini pages) or even sets of pages and complete web sites.
            <br/>
            [0009]    When an application template is provided, the designer can customize
            <br/>
            it at will ¨
            <br/>
            adding, removing or modifying all elements of the template to create his or
            <br/>
            her version of the
            <br/>
            2

            WO 2015/083115                                            PCT/1B2014/066589
            <br/>
            template. Such customization may be implemented by creating a modified version
            <br/>
            of the
            <br/>
            template (which is distinct and separate from the template). Alternatively,
            <br/>
            the website building
            <br/>
            system may apply the customizations through an inheritance-type mechanism
            <br/>
            which retains the
            <br/>
            link to the original template, and would thus reflect later changes made to
            <br/>
            the template.
            <br/>
            [0010]    Website building systems can also be extended using third party
            <br/>
            applications and
            <br/>
            components embedded in them. Such third party applications may be included in
            <br/>
            the website
            <br/>
            building system design environment or may be purchased (or otherwise acquired)
            <br/>
            separately
            <br/>
            through a number of distribution mechanisms, such as from an application store
            <br/>
            (AppStore)
            <br/>
            integrated into the website building system, or from a separate, web-based or
            <br/>
            standalone
            <br/>
            application repository (or AppStore) operated by the website building systems
            <br/>
            (WBS) vendor or
            <br/>
            by another entity. Third party applications may be also be obtained directly
            <br/>
            from the third party
            <br/>
            application vendor (through an AppStore or not) ¨ which would provide an
            <br/>
            actual installation
            <br/>
            module, or just an activation or access code.
            <br/>
            [0011]    A third party application may include any combination of front-end
            <br/>
            (display)
            <br/>
            elements with back-office elements (which are not a part of the visual web
            <br/>
            site display). The
            <br/>
            third party application may be entirely back-office (i.e. include no display
            <br/>
            element), entirely
            <br/>
            front-end (i.e. be activated only within the context of web site use) or be a
            <br/>
            combination of the
            <br/>
            two.
            <br/>
            [0012]    The back-office element of the third party application may include
            <br/>
            functions such as
            <br/>
            data-base communication, external update options etc. For example, a blog
            <br/>
            third party
            <br/>
            application might include a back-office element which allow updates to be
            <br/>
            received from non-
            <br/>
            human sources (e.g. a RSS news feed from a major news service), as well as
            <br/>
            from human
            <br/>
            sources not related to the web site (e.g. a stand-alone smart-phone
            <br/>
            application which allows
            <br/>
            submission of blog entries).

            [0013]    The integration of the visual element of a third party application
            <br/>
            into the containing
            <br/>
            web site can be done in a number of ways. Widget-type third party applications
            <br/>
            can be
            <br/>
            embedded inside a web site page as a component whereas section-type third
            <br/>
            party applications
            <br/>
            can be added to the web site as an additional page or pages.
            <br/>
            [0014]    Furthermore third party applications (both widget and section) can
            <br/>
            be single-page
            <br/>
            third party applications or multi-page third party applications (which have
            <br/>
            internal mini-pages
            <br/>
            represented as an internal URL structure). A system may implement any or all
            <br/>
            of the four
            <br/>
            possible combinations (widget or section, single-page or multi-page).
            <br/>
            [0015]    Multi-page third party applications usually provide a default
            <br/>
            "landing" mini-page,
            <br/>
            which could be an opening page, a specific internal mini-page (e.g. the most
            <br/>
            recent blog entry in
            <br/>
            a blog third party application), a mini-page selection screen or some other
            <br/>
            mini-page.
            <br/>
            [0016]    The use of third party applications in website building system-based
            <br/>
            web sites is done
            <br/>
            through third party application instances. The website building system may
            <br/>
            support multiple
            <br/>
            uses of third party applications at a number of levels, such as allowing a
            <br/>
            single third party
            <br/>
            application instance in the entire web site; allowing instances of multiple
            <br/>
            third party
            <br/>
            applications to be created inside the web site (but not more than one instance
            <br/>
            of any given third
            <br/>
            party application) and allowing multiple instances of multiple third party
            <br/>
            applications to be
            <br/>
            created, but no more than one instance per a given page. It may also allow
            <br/>
            multiple instances per
            <br/>
            page of component third party applications but not of section third party
            <br/>
            applications and may
            <br/>

            DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION
            <br/>
            [0072]    In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are
            <br/>
            set forth in order
            <br/>
            to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be
            <br/>
            understood by those
            <br/>
            skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these
            <br/>
            specific details. In
            <br/>
            other instances, well-known methods, procedures, and components have not been
            <br/>
            described in
            <br/>
            detail so as not to obscure the present invention.
            <br/>
            [0073]    Applicants have realized that are numerous limitations of current
            <br/>
            methods in the way
            <br/>
            third party applications are typically integrated into website building
            <br/>
            systems and in the way in
            <br/>
            which integrated third party applications and website building systems
            <br/>
            interact.
            <br/>
            [0074]    These limitations include the third party application display being
            <br/>
            limited to a single
            <br/>
            rectangular area inside the containing web page, the area contained in the
            <br/>
            iframe. They also
            <br/>
            include the ability of the third party application to control its own windows'
            <br/>
            size and position,
            <br/>
            as well visual elements which are outside the actual the third party
            <br/>
            application display window
            <br/>
            (e.g. specialized display frames around the third party application window).
            <br/>
            [0075]    The third party application may have its own display styles (color
            <br/>
            schemes, fonts,
            <br/>
            character sizes, etc.). These styles may be good for some containing web pages
            <br/>
            but may be
            <br/>
            visually problematic or discordant with other containing web pages.
            <br/>
            [0076]    Another limitation is the rigidity of the third party application
            <br/>
            display from the view
            <br/>
            point of the containing site. If the site has to be visually modified (e.g.
            <br/>
            due to deployment to a
            <br/>
            platform with different screen size or due to dynamic layout event), the
            <br/>
            containing web page
            <br/>
            may be required to change the size of the window allocated to the third party
            <br/>
            application. In
            <br/>
            such a case, the third party application display would be clipped and would
            <br/>
            require scrolling via
            <br/>
            scroll bars to reach different sub-areas in the third party application.
            <br/>
            Reference is now made to
            <br/>
            Fig. 6 which illustrates an example of what may happen when containing web
            <br/>
            page [a] is

            WO 2015/083115                                            PCT/1B2014/066589
            <br/>
            resized, the area allocated to the e-Shop third party application[b] is
            <br/>
            reduced, and the
            <br/>
            "Purchase" button [c] can't be viewed together with the content of the
            <br/>
            shopping cart [d] ¨
            <br/>
            requiring multiple scrolling actions to complete a purchase, and making is
            <br/>
            vastly less likely that
            <br/>
            a purchase would in fact be completed.
            <br/>
            [0077]    It will be appreciated that a third party application cannot
            <br/>
            interact with other
            <br/>
            components in the containing webpage and that such an interaction is sometimes
            <br/>
            required to
            <br/>
            achieve complex functionality. In particular, there is no way for the third
            <br/>
            party application to
            <br/>
            perform differently according to the type and content of the components in the
            <br/>
            containing web
            <br/>
            page. An example of this may be a website that streams an online cookery
            <br/>
            course. The user may
            <br/>
            wish to have in the background to watching his movie, a small area of his
            <br/>
            screen dedicated to a
            <br/>
            feed with news and weather updates in another area of his screen (such as a
            <br/>
            live stream from
            <br/>
            CNN). He may wish to automatically pause his learning session when the weather
            <br/>
            report for his
            <br/>
            residential area begins.
            <br/>
            [0078]    There is also no clear, standard way for multiple third party
            <br/>
            applications to cooperate
            <br/>
            with each other, in particular if they are provided by different vendors.
            <br/>
            Thus, a designer has no
            <br/>
            clear way to combine multiple third party applications from different vendors.
            <br/>
            An example of
            <br/>
            this may be for an ecommerce website running a module from a third party

            designer 5 to specify
            <br/>
            any specific communication connection and rules between the containing webpage

            system 30 may
            <br/>
            register the third party application 40 and its configuration data the first
            <br/>
            time the third party
            <br/>
            application 40 is installed in a web site created by designer 5 through
            <br/>
            website building system

            30.
            <br/>
            [0085]    It will be appreciated that in order for linker 23 to provide the
            <br/>
            ability to setup
            <br/>
            potential communication channels, third party application 40 needs to be able
            <br/>
            to properly
            <br/>
            recognize and identify components in containing web page 203 (with which it
            <br/>
            would like to
            <br/>
            communicate) ¨ including other third party application 40 instances. For
            <br/>
            components based on
            <br/>
            an associated template (described in more detail herein below), the
            <br/>
            identification is performed in
            <br/>
            advance by the third party application 40 vendor. Components in the associated
            <br/>
            template may be
            <br/>
            given specific reference ID's, and these ID's may be used by third party
            <br/>
            application 40 when
            <br/>
            communicating with them.
            <br/>
            [0086]    It will be further appreciated that for multi-part third party
            <br/>
            applications 40 (described
            <br/>
            in more detail herein below), i.e. a single third party application 40 spread
            <br/>
            over multiple
            <br/>
            iframes, the multiple parts may automatically know how to communicate with
            <br/>
            each other.
            <br/>
            [0087]    For containing website page components not included in an associated
            <br/>
            template (as
            <br/>
            described in more detail herein below), third party application 40 may include
            <br/>
            a list of required

            (mandatory and optional) containing web page 203 components which should exist
            <br/>
            so it may
            <br/>
            function. The list may be stored within property sheet 23 and include unique

            and component details (e.g. must be a text component, would be used as blog
            <br/>
            talkback label).
            <br/>
            The list may be detailed in the third party application 40 entry into AppStore

            25, and designer 5
            <br/>
            may use linker 23 to specify components (fields) in containing web page 203

            conforming to the
            <br/>
            third party application 40 requirements. It will be appreciated that website
            <br/>
            building system 30
            <br/>
            may dynamically create missing containing web page 203 components when the

            <br/>
            application 40 instance is created, and may allow designer 5 to move, resize

            and fully specify
            <br/>
            them later.
            <br/>
            [0088]    Alternatively, website building system 30 may expose a full or
            <br/>
            partial component
            <br/>
            model of containing web page 203 to the third party applications 40 included
            <br/>
            in containing web
            <br/>
            page 203. It will be appreciated that this may be a component model and not
            <br/>
            the Document
            <br/>
            Object Model (DOM) of containing web page 203. The containing web page 203 DOM
            <br/>
            may be
            <br/>
            far more complicated and detailed than the component model, since the actual
            <br/>
            containing web
            <br/>
            page 203 may contain numerous HTML elements ¨ both hidden and visible ¨ which
            <br/>
            are part of
            <br/>
            the website building system 30 infrastructure or which support containing web
            <br/>
            page 203
            <br/>
            components. The component model would thus be much simpler.
            <br/>
            [0089]    Reference is now made to Fig. 8 which illustrates how a text
            <br/>
            component [a] may be
            <br/>
            implemented using a number of HTML constructs (such as the enclosing div tag
            <br/>
            [b], internal
            <br/>
            div tag [c], frame "mini widgets" [d1]..[d5] etc.). The DOM model [e] for
            <br/>
            containing web page
            <br/>
            203 may contain separate DOM tree nodes for each of these sub-elements. The
            <br/>
            component
            <br/>
            model [f] may be much simpler, containing just a single component node [g].
            <br/>
            [0090]    It will be appreciated that system 100 may also support selective
            <br/>
            component exposure
            <br/>
            ¨ designer 5 may designate via linker 23 which components should be exposed to
            <br/>
            third party
            <br/>
            application 40, and only these components (possibly including the "containment
            <br/>
            path" leading
            <br/>
            to them) may be included in the simplified component model visible to third
            <br/>
            party application
            <br/>
            40. The specification may be performed by explicitly marking the included
            <br/>
            components,

            linking in which
            <br/>
            third party application 40 may send a communication during runtime to record a
            <br/>
            particular
            <br/>
            event. This communication maybe optional or mandatory (i.e. the third party

            that has been linked
            <br/>
            to receive such messages. For example, third party application 40 may

            broadcast information
            <br/>
            packets about the activities it performs, and any installed logging third

            client 10
            <br/>
            comprises viewer 201 to display containing web pages 203. It will be
            <br/>
            appreciated that viewer
            <br/>
            201 may comprise multiple view ports 202, each to display a different instance
            <br/>
            of third party
            <br/>
            application 40 (the instances derived from one or more third party application
            <br/>
            40). Client 10
            <br/>
            also comprises communication hub 205 to promote communication and to provide a
            <br/>
            back
            <br/>
            channel between containing web page 203 and any third party applications 40 it
            <br/>
            is hosting
            <br/>
            together with any communication that is required between the hosted third
            <br/>
            party applications 40
            <br/>
            without any connection to the pertinent containing web page 203. The
            <br/>
            functionality of hub 205
            <br/>
            will be described in more detail herein below.
            <br/>
            [0094]    It will be appreciated that hub 205 may be implemented on client 10
            <br/>
            since containing
            <br/>
            web page 203 and any third party application 40 inclusions are both
            <br/>
            interactive parts of the
            <br/>
            visible web site and their communication should not be delayed by a client-
            <br/>
            server round-trip. In

            an alternative embodiment, hub 205 may be implemented on website building
            <br/>
            system server 20
            <br/>
            in the cases where the third party application servers 40 need to exchange a
            <br/>
            lot of data and it is
            <br/>
            preferable better not to route them through client 10.
            <br/>
            [0095]    It will be appreciated that communication hub 205 may support
            <br/>
            different
            <br/>
            combinations of communication between web site building system 30 and one or
            <br/>
            more third
            <br/>
            party applications 40 as well as between multiple third party applications 40.
            <br/>
            For example, hub
            <br/>
            205 may enable third party application 40 to request website building system
            <br/>
            30 to switch to
            <br/>
            another page in the main site. Communication hub 205 may also enable a third
            <br/>
            party application
            <br/>
            40 to request to resize its own window possibly affecting the layout of the
            <br/>
            containing page. This
            <br/>
            may be done through dynamic layout handling described in more detail herein
            <br/>
            below.
            <br/>
            Alternatively, containing web page 203 may request (for example) that the
            <br/>
            third party
            <br/>
            application 40 switch to a different version if this is required to
            <br/>
            accommodate change in the
            <br/>
            display. It will be appreciated that this 2-way communication may also be
            <br/>
            initiated between a
            <br/>
            third party application 40 component and a web site building system 30
            <br/>
            component related to
            <br/>
            third party application 40 which displays additional information as well as
            <br/>
            communication
            <br/>
            between elements of multi-part third party applications 40 and modular third
            <br/>
            party applications
            <br/>
            as described here in above.
            <br/>
            [0096]    It will be further appreciated that system 100 may also be
            <br/>
            implemented using both an
            <br/>
            on-line and offline website building system 30, and that it may use any
            <br/>
            combination of hosting
            <br/>
            methods, such as client-side elements, website building system 30 vendor
            <br/>
            servers, third party
            <br/>
            application 40 vendor servers and other fourth party servers. It will be
            <br/>
            appreciated that for an
            <br/>
            offline embodiment as described herein above a server may still be required to
            <br/>
            implement
            <br/>
            system 100.

            <br/>
            [0097]    System 100 may also be hosted on a different server set (not
            <br/>
            operated by the website
            <br/>
            building system vendor) such as a private site hosting arrangement for a large
            <br/>
            organization.
            <br/>
            [0098]    System 100 may also support the full gamut of third party
            <br/>
            application 40 instances
            <br/>
            inclusion options from third party application 40 as discussed herein above.
            <br/>
            However, system
            <br/>
            100 may also only support a subset of these options or may place a restriction
            <br/>
            on third party
            <br/>
            application 40 instance inclusion possibilities.
            <br/>
            [0099]    System 100 may also implement multi-part third party applications
            <br/>
            40. A multi-part
            <br/>
            third party application 40 may include multiple displayed regions, each of
            <br/>
            which is handled
            <br/>
            using a separate iframe. These regions may also cooperate (as needed) through
            <br/>
            communication
            <br/>
            hub 205 as described in more detail herein below.
            <br/>
            [00100] Reference is now made to Fig. 9 which illustrates an example of a
            <br/>
            multi-part third
            <br/>
            party application 40. As is shown, a blog third party application [a] acquired
            <br/>
            from AppStore [b]
            <br/>
            is placed in containing web page 203 [c]. The blog third party application [a]
            <br/>
            includes three
            <br/>
            regions as follows: a blog entry region [d]; a tag cloud region [e]; a news
            <br/>
            update region [f]. It
            <br/>
            will be appreciated that a multi-part third party application may use its
            <br/>
            multiple regions in a
            <br/>
            number of ways, including as multiple concurrently-resident parts of a single
            <br/>
            application ¨ as in
            <br/>
            the blog example above or as multiple optionally-resident parts of a single
            <br/>
            application ¨ with a
            <br/>
            number of regions which are always visible and a number of regions which are
            <br/>
            optional and are
            <br/>
            only displayed as required. The display of the optional regions may be
            <br/>
            controlled by third party
            <br/>
            application 40, or by designer 5 (who decides how to configure the third party
            <br/>
            application when
            <br/>
            including it). The display may also be controlled as support functionality
            <br/>
            regions, such as
            <br/>
            configuration or extra dialog regions; as an alternative display for a multi-
            <br/>
            version third party
            <br/>
            application (e.g. having a small and a large version of the third party
            <br/>
            application, or having a
            <br/>
            portrait and a landscape version of the third party application).

            <br/>
            [00101] It will be appreciated that the above mentioned functionality may be
            <br/>
            implemented
            <br/>
            using iframes for third party application 40 element display, thus gaining the
            <br/>
            encapsulation and
            <br/>
            security advantages of iframe-based architecture.
            <br/>
            [00102] It will be further that the implementation of multi-part third party
            <br/>
            applications 40
            <br/>
            requires that third party applications 40 (inside their iframes) may control
            <br/>
            the display of the
            <br/>
            various iframes (e.g. their visibility, size and position). It will be further
            <br/>
            appreciated that
            <br/>
            communication hub 205 may enable this display as described in more detail
            <br/>
            herein below.
            <br/>
            [00103] It will also be appreciated that even when a multi-part third party
            <br/>
            application 40
            <br/>
            consists (visually) of multiple elements and regions, it is still regarded as
            <br/>
            a single third party
            <br/>
            application 40 in terms of purchasing (e.g. in AppStore 25), installation,
            <br/>
            configuration and so
            <br/>
            on.
            <br/>
            [00104] In existing systems, each third party application 40 may be considered
            <br/>
            a separate
            <br/>
            entity and any cooperation between two third party applications 40 (from the
            <br/>
            same vendor or
            <br/>
            otherwise cooperating vendors) has to be developed ad-hoc, on a case by case
            <br/>
            basis. It will be
            <br/>
            appreciated that system 100 may also support modular third party applications
            <br/>
            40 which
            <br/>
            consists of multiple cooperating sub-modules which can be purchased and
            <br/>
            installed separately.
            <br/>
            [00105] Reference is now made to Fig. 10 which illustrates how a modular sales
            <br/>
            management
            <br/>
            third party application [a] might include the following sub-modules: a CRM
            <br/>
            module [b]; a lead
            <br/>
            management module [c] and an e-commerce module [d]; The single third party
            <br/>
            application
            <br/>
            vendor may provide all required third party application modules.
            <br/>
            Alternatively, a third party
            <br/>
            application vendor may provide a subset of the third party application 40
            <br/>
            modules (and
            <br/>
            functionality) and allow the designer to purchase / install complementary
            <br/>
            third party application
            <br/>
            modules from the same or additional third party application vendors. It will

            embodiment shown in Fig. 11A) in that considerable amount of website building
            <br/>
            system 30
            <br/>
            level information may be processed inside a module included in a third party
            <br/>
            application, and
            <br/>
            this information might be accessed (or even modified) by a malicious third
            <br/>
            party application.
            <br/>
            [00125] As discussed herein above, in all the cross-communication methods
            <br/>
            described herein
            <br/>
            above, iframe addressing is based on the origin of the iframe (including
            <br/>
            source domain, protocol
            <br/>
            and port i.e. using direct third party application 40 addressing when sending
            <br/>
            a message (to
            <br/>
            specify the recipient) as well as when receiving a message (as the name of the
            <br/>
            sender provided
            <br/>
            to the recipient). In addition message sending requires the sender to specify
            <br/>
            the target iframe
            <br/>
            window (using JavaScript' s document.getElementByld("...").contentWindow call
            <br/>
            or any other
            <br/>
            method). Thus, in existing systems, each third party application 40 must
            <br/>
            contain the full and
            <br/>
            specific details of any other third party application 40 with which it may
            <br/>
            communicate
            <br/>
            (including domain, protocol, port and iframe ID).
            <br/>
            [00126] It will be appreciated that this type of direct addressing may be
            <br/>
            unwieldy in the
            <br/>
            environment of system 100. Even though designer 5 may integrate third party
            <br/>
            applications 40
            <br/>
            from multiple non-coordinated third party application 40 vendors, third party
            <br/>
            application 40
            <br/>
            vendors may supply third party applications 40 which are hosted in given
            <br/>
            domain, but are later
            <br/>
            moved to a different domain or sub-domain. A third party application 40 vendor
            <br/>
            may change the
            <br/>
            protocol or port used to contact any given third party application. Designer 5
            <br/>
            may be required to
            <br/>
            modify the design of containing web page 203 containing third party
            <br/>
            application 40. All of these
            <br/>
            may occur in the third party applications 40 used in a web site which is
            <br/>
            operational and is being
            <br/>
            accessed by numerous users. In addition, a single containing web page 203 may
            <br/>
            include
            <br/>
            multiple instances of one third party application 40 which may serve different
            <br/>
            functions. For
            <br/>
            example, a single page in a product support web site might contain two chat
            <br/>
            third party
            <br/>

            to converse with a
            <br/>
            vendors' support person when available.
            <br/>
            [00127] It will be appreciated that addresser and identifier 310 may be fully
            <br/>
            aware of the
            <br/>
            structure of containing web page 203 and of the details of third party
            <br/>
            application 40 (as provided
            <br/>
            by the third party application 40 vendor to the website building system 30).
            <br/>
            Addresser and
            <br/>
            identifier 310 may provide addressing of source or target third party
            <br/>
            applications 40 to each
            <br/>
            other using any of the following: a third party application 40 unique name (as
            <br/>
            registered in
            <br/>
            AppStore 25); a third party application 40 instance descriptive ID added to
            <br/>
            each third party
            <br/>
            application 40 instance in containing web page 203 thus allowing the
            <br/>
            addressing of multiple
            <br/>
            instances of the same third party application 40; a generic identifier for a
            <br/>
            required third party
            <br/>
            application type / class (e.g. "I would like to send the message &lt;x&gt; to any
            <br/>
            event logging third
            <br/>
            party application 40 instance in containing web page 203"). Such an identifier
            <br/>
            may also describe
            <br/>
            the specific services which should be supported by the third party application
            <br/>
            40. Addresser and
            <br/>
            identifier 310 may also use version indication for example: "I would like to
            <br/>
            send the transaction
            <br/>
            &lt;x&gt; to an instance of the accounting package &lt;y&gt; but only if it is of version
            <br/>
            &lt;z&gt;".
            <br/>
            [00128] It will be appreciated that during runtime, third party applications
            <br/>
            40 only
            <br/>
            communicate with hub 205, and therefore only need to know direct address of
            <br/>
            hub 205, and not
            <br/>
            of any other third party application 40. This one direct address may be
            <br/>
            encapsulated by a
            <br/>
            communication API wrapper (such as communication modules f and g as is
            <br/>
            illustrated in Fig.
            <br/>
            11A and communication modules a and b as illustrated in Fig. 11B) provided by
            <br/>
            the website
            <br/>
            building system 30 to the third party application 40 provider. The calling
            <br/>
            third party application
            <br/>
            40 may provide the application-aware third party application 40 descriptive
            <br/>
            addresses (as
            <br/>
            described above) and addresser and identifier 310 may translate them into
            <br/>
            direct third party
            <br/>
            application 40 addresses and perform the routing. This way, third party
            <br/>
            application 40 does not

            need to maintain a table of the absolute addresses of all possible third party
            <br/>
            applications 40 with
            <br/>
            which it communicates.
            <br/>
            [00129] It will be appreciated that message originator verification is
            <br/>
            critical otherwise a
            <br/>
            receiving third party application 40 may receive a message from a hostile
            <br/>
            third party application
            <br/>
            40. Since all communication may occur via hub 205, originator verifier 320 may
            <br/>
            check the
            <br/>
            authenticity of all incoming messages from third party applications.
            <br/>
            Originator verifier 320 may
            <br/>
            also provide additional information which may be added to the message and may
            <br/>
            be used for
            <br/>
            additional verification. It will be appreciated that since every third party
            <br/>
            application 40 included
            <br/>
            in AppStore 25 and used by system 100 is registered with website building
            <br/>
            system 30, hub 205
            <br/>
            may verify with web site building system 30 if a unique originator ID which
            <br/>
            may be included in
            <br/>
            the message, matches the message origin (domain, port, etc.).
            <br/>
            [00130] Third party application 40 may define a general communication policy
            <br/>
            which may
            <br/>
            depend on external information, containing web page 203 information etc.
            <br/>
            Communication
            <br/>
            enforcer 330 may ensure that the communication policy in question is enforced
            <br/>
            without having
            <br/>
            to deal with non-conforming communication. For example, in a classified
            <br/>
            information handling
            <br/>
            web site, third party applications might be tagged with a classification level
            <br/>
            field in their profile.
            <br/>
            A third party application 40 providing a back-end event logging database which
            <br/>
            is certified to a
            <br/>
            classification level X may define a policy thereby it will not accept events
            <br/>
            for logging which
            <br/>
            have a classification level greater than X. Communication enforcer 330 may in
            <br/>
            such a situation,
            <br/>
            perform the required preliminary filtering, and prevent highly classified
            <br/>
            messages from even
            <br/>
            reaching the lower classification application.
            <br/>
            [00131] It will be further appreciated that designer 5 may wish to include two
            <br/>
            (or more) third
            <br/>
            party applications in the same created web-site which could possibly
            <br/>
            cooperate, but do not
            <br/>
            actually do so due to some protocol compatibility issue. For example as is

            <br/>
            to which reference is now made, e-Shop third party application [a] may have
            <br/>
            the capability to

            post purchase order messages to a fulfillment and shipping third party

            application such as the
            <br/>
            third party application [b] (provided by a different vendor). However, the

            information provided
            <br/>
            by the third party application [a] may not include some fields required by the
            <br/>
            third party
            <br/>
            application [b]. Such situation should typically be resolved by the third

            party application
            <br/>
            vendors of the third party applications involved, but in some cases such
            <br/>
            resolution is not
            <br/>
            possible (e.g. one of the two third party applications is not currently

            updated for some reason).
            <br/>
            Protocol translator 340 may translate the relevant messages from [a] to [b]
            <br/>
            (e.g. by providing the
            <br/>
            additional required fields). Such translation may be performed by protocol
            <br/>
            translator 340, or
            <br/>
            may possibly involve some interaction with the embedding web site and

            <br/>
            [00132] It will be further appreciated that third party application 40 may
            <br/>
            have some
            <br/>
            capabilities which require sending or receiving messages from another third

            party application 40
            <br/>
            (such as the e-Shop / fulfillment third party application 40 pair described
            <br/>
            above). However, in
            <br/>
            some cases a part of the solution may be missing, in the above example, it may
            <br/>
            happen that no
            <br/>
            matching or appropriate fulfillment third party application 40 exists. In such
            <br/>
            a case, redirector
            <br/>
            350 may allow designer 5 to specify that given messages may be routed to or
            <br/>
            from a containing
            <br/>
            web page 203 component and that the matching capabilities may be resolved by
            <br/>
            the containing
            <br/>
            web page 203 component and the functionality the components may provide. This
            <br/>
            may allow
            <br/>
            construction of the full web site without requiring the construction of a
            <br/>
            special-purpose third
            <br/>
            party application 40. Therefore transactions may be posted to a website

            building system 30
            <br/>
            component which can perform logging of transactions to a database, and the

            370 during
            <br/>
            runtime. For example, a third party application 40 may send a website building

            capabilities it should

            provide.
            <br/>
            [00135] In an alternative implementation, website building system 30 may
            <br/>
            provide third party

            application 40 with the required third party application 40 configuration
            <br/>
            information via an

            <br/>
            [00136] As discussed herein above, third party application 40 may communicate

            <br/>
            third party
            <br/>
            application 40.
            <br/>
            [00137] It will be appreciated that during runtime, updater 380 may implement
            <br/>
            messages and
            <br/>
            responses between containing web page 203 components and third party
            <br/>
            application 40. For
            <br/>
            example third party application 40 may affect or query the visual and display
            <br/>
            attributes of
            <br/>
            containing web page 203 components (such as their position, size, color,
            <br/>
            transparency etc.).
            <br/>
            Updater 380 may also enable third party application 40 to read or write the
            <br/>
            content of containing
            <br/>
            web page 203 components and may also allow third party application 40 to
            <br/>
            direct components
            <br/>
            which perform media functions, e.g. post a given audio or video segment to a
            <br/>
            media player
            <br/>
            component, or require it to pause playing for a given period.
            <br/>
            [00138] Updater 380 may also facilitate web site building system 30 components
            <br/>
            to specify the
            <br/>
            type of access they allow third party applications 40 to have ¨ similar to the
            <br/>
            way in which access
            <br/>
            permission bits or access control lists (ACL' s) function for the protection
            <br/>
            of files in modern
            <br/>
            operating systems. Such permissions may be defined for each component so as to
            <br/>
            apply for all
            <br/>
            third party applications 40, from specific vendors or for specific third party
            <br/>
            applications 40. For
            <br/>
            example a third party application 40 may be allowed to access a text field
            <br/>
            which is part of
            <br/>
            containing web page 203 outside third party application 40. This text field
            <br/>
            may be used to edit a
            <br/>
            blog entry for a blog third party application 40, providing more screen real
            <br/>
            estate than that
            <br/>
            which can be provided inside the blog third party application 40 area itself.
            <br/>
            It will be

            appreciated that for third party applications 40 embedded into specific mini-

            pages inside a
            <br/>
            multi-page container, website building system 30 may limit the access of third

            [00139] It will also be appreciated that updater 380 may also allow a third
            <br/>
            party application 40
            <br/>
            to affect site-global elements. This may include getting and setting

            page in the site, the current mini page in a container containing third party

            application 40 and
            <br/>
            the page history. Updater 380 may also filter or limit such requests.
            <br/>
            [00140] Updater 380 may also enable website building system 30 to affect the
            <br/>
            style and
            <br/>
            display of third party application 40. Updater 380 may implement calls through
            <br/>
            which website
            <br/>
            building system 30 may provide formatting and style guidelines to the third
            <br/>
            party application 40.
            <br/>
            These may include properties such as: colors and color schemes; fonts;
            <br/>
            character sizes;
            <br/>
            transparency; animation and special effects (e.g. blurring). The color scheme,
            <br/>
            in particular, may
            <br/>
            include a generic color scheme (e.g. use the following x colors), or as high-
            <br/>
            level color (e.g. use
            <br/>
            the color x for text, color y for frames).
            <br/>
            [00141] It will be appreciated that one preferred method to express complex
            <br/>
            style information
            <br/>
            is the use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which can express a combination of
            <br/>
            multiple style
            <br/>
            directives, including fonts, sizes, colors etc. Updater 380 may send such CSS-
            <br/>
            based messages to
            <br/>
            third party application 40. The style sheets may be generic in nature, or
            <br/>
            include specific style
            <br/>
            names defined by the third party application 40, so that website building
            <br/>
            system 30 may provide
            <br/>
            better guidelines to third party application 40 (e.g. a style sheet may refer
            <br/>
            to specific third party
            <br/>
            application 40 elements and provide guidelines for them).
            <br/>
            [00142] Third party application 40 may then use these guidelines to make its
            <br/>
            own look and
            <br/>
            feel and better adapted to containing web page 203. This is particularly
            <br/>
            important for third party

            (multi-port inclusion as noted above). The multiple containing pages might
            <br/>
            employ different
            <br/>
            color scheme or general design. Third party application 40 may use the
            <br/>
            information provided to
            <br/>
            it through these style messages, and adapt its own display colors and style to

            layout event.
            <br/>
            Website building system 30 may change the size and position of the components

            the designers.
            <br/>
            [00144] It will also be appreciated that a dynamic layout event might also be
            <br/>
            caused by third
            <br/>
            party application 40. For example, an e-Shop third party application 40 may
            <br/>
            require a size
            <br/>
            change when the user moves from a product catalog view to a shopping cart view
            <br/>
            (having a
            <br/>
            different size). As another example, a product catalog third party application
            <br/>
            40 may include the
            <br/>
            option for product highlighting, which would cause them to display a larger
            <br/>
            catalog page
            <br/>
            including more content. A third example is a multi-region third party
            <br/>
            application 40 which may
            <br/>
            start or stop displaying additional regions.

            [00145] Existing system typically handle such situations (if at all) by

            clipping the third party

            building
            <br/>
            system 30 and third party applications 40 cooperate in performing dynamic

            layout and retain the
            <br/>
            basic design of containing web page 203. The functionality of dynamic layout
            <br/>
            is further
            <br/>
            described in US patent application 13/771,119 filed 20 February 2013 and

            assigned to the
            <br/>
            common assignees of the present invention. However, even in a cooperative
            <br/>
            dynamic layout
            <br/>
            supporting system, the dynamic layout mechanism in containing web page 203
            <br/>
            does not have
            <br/>
            full control of the internal layout of third party application 40.
            <br/>
            Furthermore, website building
            <br/>
            system 30 widgets may be designed so they can be resized to any arbitrary size
            <br/>
            (within a given
            <br/>
            range), but third party application 40 may not support arbitrary resizing.
            <br/>
            Third party application
            <br/>
            40 may provide, for example, any combination of the following: a number of
            <br/>
            display
            <br/>
            configurations having different sizes (e.g. display more or less details); the
            <br/>
            ability to resize some
            <br/>
            of its internal elements and the ability to display some of its internal text
            <br/>
            elements using
            <br/>
            multiple font sizes.
            <br/>
            [00146] Third party application 40 may still offer a limited number of
            <br/>
            possible display sizes,
            <br/>
            and may have the entire range of possible sizes. Therefore, a [containing web

            <br/>
            [00148] For example, third party application 40 embedded in containing web

            content to the given desired size (X 1*Y1). Third party application 40 may
            <br/>
            adjust to that size ¨

            (X1*Y1).
            <br/>
            [00149] It will be also appreciated that third party application 40 may only

            limited set of possible sizes only (e.g. specific user interface

            layout updater 360 may use the following alternative algorithm which allows
            <br/>
            the third party
            <br/>
            application 40 to provide a set of possible sizes.

            content to the given
            <br/>
            desired size (X 1*Y1). Third party application 40 may then determine the

            nearest possible size
            <br/>
            (e.g. X2*Y2 pixels) and resize accordingly by using alternative display

            [00166] It will be appreciated that dynamic layout processing may typically

            require moving
            <br/>
            the third party applications 40 and not just resizing them. However, a third

            party application 40
            <br/>
            should be invariant to the exact location of its frame inside containing web

            change the window size.
            <br/>
            [00168] It will also be appreciated that third party application 40 may also
            <br/>
            request (via
            <br/>
            dynamic layout updater 360) to change its position inside containing web page
            <br/>
            203. This may
            <br/>
            not affect third party application 40 internally (as a size change does), but
            <br/>
            does require display
            <br/>
            changes in containing web page 203. Dynamic layout updater 360 may integrate
            <br/>
            this request
            <br/>
            with the dynamic layout. Containing web page 203 may activate dynamic layout
            <br/>
            updater 360 to
            <br/>
            change the third party application 40 window size (and possibly its location)
            <br/>
            and confirm the
            <br/>
            size and position change back to third party application 40.
            <br/>
            [00169] It will be appreciated that hub 205 may also implement additional

            <br/>
            talk-back to the
            <br/>
            current blog entry. Such a message may be used by containing web page 203
            <br/>
            (e.g. as a way to
            <br/>
            post blog entries from a large editing field outside of the third party
            <br/>
            application area). It could
            <br/>
            also be used for higher-level application-to-application link, e.g. allowing a
            <br/>
            support third party
            <br/>
            application to post blog entries to a blog third party application.
            <br/>
            [00170] It will be appreciated that third party applications 40 often require
            <br/>
            a wide variety of
            <br/>
            complex services ¨ either for third party application 40 internal use or for
            <br/>
            downstream use by
            <br/>
            designers using third party application 40 in their sites. Such services may
            <br/>
            include user
            <br/>
            management, billing and shipping management. The website building system 30
            <br/>
            vendor may
            <br/>
            not be able to provide such services as part of the website building system
            <br/>
            (e.g. due to technical
            <br/>
            or business considerations). Furthermore, these services may be unsuitable for
            <br/>
            "packaging" as
            <br/>
            third party applications 40 by themselves. In addition, a third party
            <br/>
            application 40 vendor may
            <br/>
            need the option to provide multiple such services for a designer using the
            <br/>
            third party application
            <br/>
            40 (e.g. multiple 3rd party billing API's) ¨ and allow designer 5 to select
            <br/>
            the right one for his or
            <br/>
            her use.
            <br/>
            [00171] For example, a PaypalTM hosted API may be offered in website building
            <br/>
            system 30
            <br/>
            and may be used directly by third party application 40 or may be offered by
            <br/>
            third party
            <br/>
            application 40 to the designers 5 using it. Third party application 40 may
            <br/>
            also offer its own set
            <br/>
            of options (i.e. use specific billing type, such as one-time, recurring or
            <br/>
            revenue sharing), and
            <br/>
            implement these options by calling the hosted Paypal API.
            <br/>
            [00172] Thus, designer 5 using website building system 30 may develop a
            <br/>
            specific offering
            <br/>
            (such as a song-selling e-Store) which uses advanced billing. Designer 5 may
            <br/>
            avoid having to
            <br/>
            negotiate a specific clearing or merchant agreement with the billing API
            <br/>
            provider by using the
            <br/>
            hosted billing API ¨ either directly or through a third party application 40
            <br/>
            offering an additional

            abstraction level (or layer). In this sense, website building system 30 may
            <br/>
            become a distributor
            <br/>
            for the hosted API vendors.
            <br/>
            [00173] Hosted API wrapper 390 may facilitate this communication between the
            <br/>
            different
            <br/>
            parts of the system (e.g. website building system 30, the hosted API code and
            <br/>
            the included third
            <br/>
            party applications 40) It will be appreciated that the API wrapper layer, and
            <br/>
            the actual API
            <br/>
            implementation may reside within website building system 30 itself or another
            <br/>
            third party
            <br/>
            application 40.The third party application 40 vendor (or designer 5) may use
            <br/>
            an hosted API
            <br/>
            through hosted API wrapper 390 without being aware of the way in which the
            <br/>
            actual underlying
            <br/>
            API is implemented.

            [00174] In an alternative and complementary embodiment to the present
            <br/>
            invention,
            <br/>
            Applicants have also realized that smart integration between website building
            <br/>
            system 30 and
            <br/>
            one or more third party applications 40 may also be achieved by using an
            <br/>
            integration model in
            <br/>
            which additional website building system templates and components are
            <br/>
            associated with the
            <br/>
            third party applications at the level of the AppStore 25 as well as with the
            <br/>
            relevant third party
            <br/>
            application instances. Third party application 40 may also communicate with
            <br/>
            these components
            <br/>
            (as well as with non-associated components) to exchange data and control
            <br/>
            messages. As
            <br/>
            discussed herein above, third party application regions 40 within a containing
            <br/>
            web page 203 are
            <br/>
            separate iframes whose content is hosted in separate domains (third party
            <br/>
            application vendors'
            <br/>
            or otherwise) ¨ different from the domain on which the main site is hosted.
            <br/>
            Thus,
            <br/>
            communication between the different iframes is subject to browsers' "same
            <br/>
            origin policy" and
            <br/>
            requires the use of techniques as described herein above.
            <br/>
            [00175] Existing systems implement third party applications 40 as monolithic,
            <br/>
            rigid objects
            <br/>
            which are included in containing web page 203 but do not otherwise affect the

            <br/>
            containing web page 203 itself. The third party 40 instance is placed in a
            <br/>
            (typically rectangular)
            <br/>
            area, and performs all of its activities within this area.
            <br/>
            [00176] Applicants have also realized that this notion may be expanded by
            <br/>
            having an
            <br/>
            (optional) additional website building system 30 template associated with
            <br/>
            third party application
            <br/>
            40, referred to as an associated template in accordance with an embodiment of

            [00177] It will be appreciated that system 100 may support the publishing of
            <br/>
            third party
            <br/>
            applications 40 with multiple associated templates ¨ allowing designer 5 to
            <br/>
            select a template
            <br/>
            which best suites his or her needs.
            <br/>
            [00178] It will be appreciated that when creating an instance of the third
            <br/>
            party application 40
            <br/>
            in any containing web page 203, the components in the associated template may
            <br/>
            be merged with
            <br/>

            [00179] Reference is now made to Fig. 13 which illustrates an example of the
            <br/>
            use of an
            <br/>
            associated template according to an embodiment of the present invention. As is
            <br/>
            shown, third
            <br/>
            party application [a] is placed in AppStore [b] together with associated

            template [c] that
            <br/>
            includes components [d] and [e]. It will be appreciated that when third party

            application [a] is
            <br/>
            included in containing web page 203 [f], third party application [a] may be

            [i].
            <br/>
            [00180] It will be appreciated that system 100 may support multiple ways in

            which the
            <br/>
            associated template component instances (e.g. [d'] and [e'] above) are
            <br/>
            positioned in the
            <br/>
            containing web page 203 [f]. These may include: absolute placement (i.e. using
            <br/>
            the size and
            <br/>
            position specified in the associated template [c] for the original [d] and
            <br/>
            [e]); target-relative
            <br/>
            placement (i.e. adjusting the size and position of the new instances [d'] and
            <br/>
            [e'] according to the
            <br/>
            containing web page 203 [f]); and third party application 40 relative
            <br/>
            placement (i.e. adjusting
            <br/>
            the size and position of the new instances [d'] and [e'] relative to the size
            <br/>
            and position specified
            <br/>
            for the third party application instance [g] inside containing web page 203
            <br/>
            [f]). Determination of
            <br/>
            the specific placement method may be done based on settings included with the
            <br/>
            associated
            <br/>
            template [c], possibly allowing designer 5 to override it.
            <br/>
            [00181] It will be further appreciated that designer 5 may modify the
            <br/>
            instances in [f] of the
            <br/>
            components [d] and [e] inherited from the template [c]. The changes may only
            <br/>
            apply to the use
            <br/>
            of [d] and [e] within [f] (and possibly pages inheriting from within website
            <br/>
            building system 30
            <br/>
            which support inter-page inheritance), but may not affect the "original"
            <br/>
            template [c] associated
            <br/>
            with third party application [a] in AppStore [b].
            <br/>
            [00182] It will be appreciated that the changes to the [d] and [e] instances
            <br/>
            above may include,
            <br/>
            in particular, assigning specific content (text, images, etc.) to the field
            <br/>
            instances ¨ as well as
            <br/>
            regular attribute changes. It will be further appreciated that if third party
            <br/>
            application 40 is
            <br/>
            included inside a mini-page, the associated template is applied to the

            associated template
            <br/>
            (if any) is applied to the virtual (and empty) containing web page 203 created

            [00184] In an alternative embodiment, the pre-created associated template may
            <br/>
            be applied to a
            <br/>
            newly created page or mini-page, which is "parallel" to the including
            <br/>
            containing web page 203.
            <br/>
            This newly created page or mini-page may be initialized with the template,
            <br/>
            which could then be
            <br/>
            modified as desired.
            <br/>
            [00185] Website building system 30 may also allow multi-port inclusion ¨ in
            <br/>
            which the same
            <br/>
            third party application 40 instance is visible from and "resides in" multiple
            <br/>
            pages of the main
            <br/>
            site. This is different from multiple inclusion of a given third party
            <br/>
            application 40 in the main
            <br/>
            site ¨ which creates multiple instances of the third party application 40. The
            <br/>
            third party
            <br/>
            application 40 content ¨ which is instance-specific ¨ is thus shared between
            <br/>
            the multiple views
            <br/>
            of the same multi-port third party application 40.
            <br/>
            [00186] In such multi-port inclusion, the associated template may be applied
            <br/>
            separately to
            <br/>
            each of the pages and mini-page to which the third party application 40
            <br/>
            instance is added.
            <br/>
            [00187] As discussed herein above, system 100 may provide a 2-way
            <br/>
            communication link
            <br/>
            between third party application 40 and the components in containing web page
            <br/>
            203. It will be
            <br/>
            appreciated that this includes containing web page 203 components resulting
            <br/>
            from the merging
            <br/>
            of the associated template from third party application, as well as components
            <br/>
            which are
            <br/>
            unrelated to any such associated template.
            <br/>
            [00188] Thus it will be appreciated that a third party application 40 vendor
            <br/>
            may typically
            <br/>
            create a number of templates to be associated with the third party
            <br/>
            applications 40 produced by
            <br/>
            49

            <br/>
            WO 2015/083115                                            PCT/1B2014/066589
            <br/>
            the vendor. These templates may include test, development and other templates
            <br/>
            in addition to
            <br/>
            the templates which are actually being distributed (i.e. associated with
            <br/>
            currently distributed third
            <br/>
            party application versions).
            <br/>
            [00189] As discussed herein above, third party application 40 may be
            <br/>
            distributed through
            <br/>
            AppStore 25, and may also be distributed through alternative channels not
            <br/>
            related to or managed
            <br/>
            by the website building system 30 vendor. However, the associated templates
            <br/>
            distributed with
            <br/>
            third party application 40 may be highly related to and coupled with
            <br/>
            application repository 22,
            <br/>
            as they are built using components, base templates and other elements managed
            <br/>
            by website
            <br/>
            building system 30.
            <br/>
            [00190] Furthermore, website building system 30 elements underlying such a
            <br/>
            separately-
            <br/>
            distributed associated template may have to be modified or deleted ¨ possibly
            <br/>
            "breaking" the
            <br/>
            associated template. To resolve this problem, system 100 may implement these
            <br/>
            associated
            <br/>
            templates in a separate area (possibly per-third party application 40 vendor)
            <br/>
            inside application
            <br/>
            repository 22. Website building system 30 may manage these templates in the
            <br/>
            same way as
            <br/>
            other website building system 30 templates.
            <br/>
            [00191] It will also be appreciated that the third party application 40 vendor
            <br/>
            may be provided
            <br/>
            with a unique ID (the development ID) for each template created, and may use
            <br/>
            this ID during
            <br/>
            third party application 40 development and testing process. Once third party
            <br/>
            application 40 is to
            <br/>
            be published / distributed, the third party application 40 vendor may be
            <br/>
            required to apply for and
            <br/>
            receive an alternate unique ID (the publishing ID), and may reference it in
            <br/>
            the published third
            <br/>
            party application 40. Once a publishing ID is provided, a separate locked copy
            <br/>
            of the template is
            <br/>
            created. This is the copy referenced by third party application 40 and used
            <br/>
            when creating
            <br/>
            instances of the third party application 40. In this way, the third party
            <br/>
            application 40 vendor is
            <br/>
            unable to mistakenly modify a template associated with a "live" third party
            <br/>
            application 40
            <br/>
            <br/>
            CA 02932286 2016-05-31
            <br/>
            WO 2015/083115                                            PCT/1B2014/066589
            <br/>
            (which is being included by designers) and referential integrity is preserved.
            <br/>
            Furthermore,
            <br/>
            system 100 may cross-reference the relationship between such locked templates
            <br/>
            and the
            <br/>
            underlying components and base templates. This cross-reference can be used,
            <br/>
            for example, to
            <br/>
            provide a warning to website building system 30 staff if a website building
            <br/>
            system 30
            <br/>
            component or a base template included in such a locked template is to be
            <br/>
            modified (and such
            <br/>
            modification may break the template or the third party application 40 in some
            <br/>
            way).
            <br/>
            [00192] Therefore system 100 may provide bi-directional communication channels
            <br/>
            between
            <br/>
            third party applications 40, the components in containing web page 203 and
            <br/>
            website building
            <br/>
            system 30. Containing web page 203 components may be based on a template(s)
            <br/>
            associated with
            <br/>
            the third party application, based other website building system 30 templates,
            <br/>
            or be unrelated to
            <br/>
            any template.
            <br/>
            [00193] As discussed herein above, communication hub 205 may promote
            <br/>
            communication
            <br/>
            and may provide a back channel between a containing web page and any third
            <br/>
            party applications
            <br/>
            40. Applicants have further realized that the data that is flowing backwards
            <br/>
            and forwards
            <br/>
            between a containing web page and any third party applications 40 may be
            <br/>
            useful once
            <br/>
            collected, processed and integrated.
            <br/>
            [00194] For example, web site owners need to manage their per-site user
            <br/>
            population or
            <br/>
            membership which may be distinct from the registered user base of the
            <br/>
            pertinent website
            <br/>
            building system 30. Web site users may be registered or not (anonymous) and
            <br/>
            the website may
            <br/>
            provide different levels of capabilities to different levels of users.
            <br/>
            Furthermore, users may often
            <br/>
            provide personal or contact information (even as anonymous users) such as data
            <br/>
            in a contact
            <br/>
            form, when they activate instant messenger software to contact a site owner or
            <br/>
            when they
            <br/>
            connect to a social network as part of working with the site. It will be
            <br/>
            appreciated that this

            <br/>
            information may be entered directly into the created site, or may be made
            <br/>
            available as part of the
            <br/>
            interaction with third party applications 40 embedded within the site.
            <br/>
            [00195] It will be further appreciated that these pieces of information may be
            <br/>
            un-organized,
            <br/>
            un-correlated, potentially contradictory and many times not saved at all. For
            <br/>
            example a single
            <br/>
            given user may enter his personal email on a contact form (operated directly
            <br/>
            by the site) and his
            <br/>
            work email in a separate subscription form (operated by third party
            <br/>
            application 40) in the same
            <br/>
            session.
            <br/>
            [00196] Furthermore, those "floating" pieces of information may include
            <br/>
            different
            <br/>
            permissions for their use. For example, users filling in their email address
            <br/>
            in a subscription form
            <br/>
            fully expect to receive the email-based subscription they have subscribed to
            <br/>
            and possibly related
            <br/>
            email newsletters. On the other hand, a user that supplies an email address as
            <br/>
            a registration ID
            <br/>
            may not wish to receive any emails to his registration address apart from e-
            <br/>
            mails relating to his
            <br/>
            account handling, security alerts etc.
            <br/>
            [00197] Reference is now made to Fig. 15 which illustrates a system 200 for
            <br/>
            coordinating and
            <br/>
            collecting data from different messages exchanged between a website building
            <br/>
            system 30 and

            one or more embedded third party applications 40. System 200 comprises a

            system 200. This
            <br/>
            may be done through merging rules which reconcile disparate and possibly
            <br/>
            contradicting
            <br/>
            information. The united information may be stored in contacts database 245.

            This information
            <br/>
            may also include usage permission fields controlling the allowed use of the

            information as described in more detail herein below.
            <br/>
            [00202] In alternative embodiments to the present invention, both client hub
            <br/>
            210 and server
            <br/>
            hub 230 alone may be used to communicate with the multiple third party

            applications 40 40
            <br/>
            installed on servers 270. It will be appreciated that in the situation where
            <br/>
            only client hub 210 is
            <br/>
            used, contacts coordinator 240, activity coordinator 250 together with
            <br/>
            databases 245 and 255
            <br/>
            may be installed locally on the pertinent client.
            <br/>
            [00203] It will be further appreciated that system 200 may comprise further
            <br/>
            components
            <br/>
            which may allow third party applications 40 to manage user contacting
            <br/>
            activities (e.g. mass
            <br/>
            mailing of newsletters) while enforcing the usage limitations set by the users
            <br/>
            themselves. Such
            <br/>
            components may even insulate the user private data from the third party
            <br/>
            applications 40 ¨ so
            <br/>
            that the third party applications 40 may perform their actions without having
            <br/>
            actual access to
            <br/>
            private user data. Such a capability may be implemented, for example, using
            <br/>
            private data proxy
            <br/>
            234 as described in more detail herein below.

            [00204] It will also be appreciated that contacts database 245 may be specific
            <br/>
            to each site.
            <br/>
            However, website building system 30 may define a meta-site/project level which
            <br/>
            contains a
            <br/>
            collection of web sites (owned by the same site owner) and allow specifying
            <br/>
            that contacts are
            <br/>
            stored, handled and merged at the meta-site level, rather than single site
            <br/>
            level. Other site
            <br/>
            elements (such as included third party applications 40) may also be defined at
            <br/>
            the meta-site
            <br/>
            rather than site level. Other than meta-site support, system 200 may typically
            <br/>
            not share contacts
            <br/>

            <br/>
            sites or different
            <br/>
            site owners (so that the data provided by a given end-user to one site is not
            <br/>
            leaked to another
            <br/>
            site).
            <br/>
            [00205] As discussed herein above, system 200 may support multiple
            <br/>
            interactions between
            <br/>
            website building system 30 and one or more third party applications 40. Such
            <br/>
            interactions may
            <br/>
            be predefined activities such as making a purchase, adding an item to a
            <br/>
            shopping cart, filling in
            <br/>
            contact information etc. A third party application 40 may specify which
            <br/>
            activities it supports and
            <br/>
            other third party applications 40 may "listen" to specific activities and act
            <br/>
            upon received
            <br/>
            activities and their associated information. It will be appreciated that list
            <br/>
            of listened to activities
            <br/>
            for a given third party application 40 may be set explicitly to one or more
            <br/>
            activities or may be
            <br/>
            determined by an activity listening query as described in more detail herein
            <br/>
            below.
            <br/>
            [00206] It will be appreciated that each activity may be considered a message
            <br/>
            and that each
            <br/>
            message may include an activity data structure. The activity data structures
            <br/>
            are predefined data
            <br/>
            types, but may be defined through inheritance between them and through third
            <br/>
            party
            <br/>
            applications 40 which may have the option to extend them by adding fields.
            <br/>
            They may be
            <br/>
            specific to the system, or may be based on or include standardized data
            <br/>
            structures. They may
            <br/>
            also be encoded in some manner, such as XML, JSON data or using a binary
            <br/>
            object encoding
            <br/>
            scheme.
            <br/>
            [00207] The activity data structure may also include a third party application
            <br/>
            40 provided
            <br/>
            "description" field. This is a third party application 40 based description of
            <br/>
            the activity (which
            <br/>
            may be more detailed than what is known to website building system 30). For
            <br/>
            example, a VOIP
            <br/>
            communication third party application 40 may provide an activity description
            <br/>
            text of "Call to

            <br/>
            [00208] The activity data structure may further include a callback link, e.g.
            <br/>
            "more
            <br/>
            information", which returns to the activity data structure. This may be used
            <br/>
            to provide additional
            <br/>
            substantial information, such as: for an e-commerce activity data structure:
            <br/>
            full order tracking
            <br/>
            information, history of orders etc.; for a chat activity data structure: full
            <br/>
            chat transcript and for a
            <br/>
            telephony activity data structure: recording of call. Thus, a sample complete
            <br/>
            activity data
            <br/>
            structure may contain the following fields: creation timestamp; activity type;
            <br/>
            source of activity
            <br/>
            (third party application 40 / component ID); activity stream ID; activity type-

            database ID; the
            <br/>
            ID/URL of the site page in which the activity occurred; the activity

            user details etc.
            <br/>
            [00209] Activity coordinator 250 may be considered a logging element and may
            <br/>
            receive the
            <br/>
            data from a passing message from hub 230. Stream creator 251 may create an
            <br/>
            initial stream
            <br/>
            which may be considered a log or chain like structure and stream merger 252
            <br/>
            may add to it any
            <br/>
            additional incoming activity with each stream being unique to a contact. It
            <br/>
            will be appreciated
            <br/>
            that stream creator 251 may not create a new stream for each separate activity
            <br/>
            contained in
            <br/>
            different messages. It will be further appreciated that activities contained
            <br/>
            in the stream may be
            <br/>
            out of sequence (for example a third party application 40 may be delayed in
            <br/>
            reporting the
            <br/>
            activity). Stream merger 252 may merge streams during an operation if they

            Horizontal stream

            merger 263 may merge two unrelated streams due to a detected common primary ID

            and
            <br/>
            vertical stream merger 264 may merge a stream created for an anonymous contact
            <br/>
            with the
            <br/>
            stream associated with a registered user upon login or registration which may
            <br/>
            connect the two. It
            <br/>
            will be appreciated that stream merger 252 may access previously created

            streams from activity

            stream database 255 when necessary.
            <br/>
            [00211] For example, an anonymous user fills in a contact form in a site.
            <br/>
            Stream creator 251
            <br/>
            may create a new activity stream (with the ID "anon 1") and contacts handler
            <br/>
            242 may create a
            <br/>
            new contact (with the ID "anon 1" as described in more detail herein below).
            <br/>
            The same user may
            <br/>
            then chat with the site owner. Stream merger 252 may then merge this activity
            <br/>
            into the "anon 1"
            <br/>
            activity stream and the contact "anon 1" is updated (as described in more
            <br/>
            detail herein below).
            <br/>
            The user, using a different browser, then fills in a schedule form. As there
            <br/>
            is no a correlation to
            <br/>
            the original user, stream creator 251 may create a new activity stream with
            <br/>
            the ID "anon 2" and
            <br/>
            contacts handler 242 may create a new contact with the ID "anon 2".
            <br/>
            [00212] The user then purchases something from the site. Stream merger 252
            <br/>
            merges the new
            <br/>
            activity into the "anon 2" activity stream and the contact "anon 2" may be
            <br/>
            updated (with a

            registered, all users
            <br/>
            receive a "user x" ID from the membership handler of the site. At this point

            contact handler 242 may
            <br/>
            create a new contact (with the same ID "user x").
            <br/>
            [00214] Later, the user returns from another browser and chats with the site

            owner. As the
            <br/>
            website does not have a cookie, stream creator 251 may create yet another new

            with an "anon 3"
            <br/>
            ID and a "user x" ID. Data merger 243 may merge the contacts "anon 3" into
            <br/>
            "user x", so that

            <br/>
            [00216] It will be appreciated that the site owner may access the history of

            the activity stream
            <br/>
            for a given contact through a pertinent user interface provided by website

            building system 30 as
            <br/>
            is illustrated in Fig. 17 to which reference is now made. For a single contact

            "Dani Bronstein",
            <br/>
            the history of his website use can be easily accessed. It will also be

            building system 30 or third party application 40 may also provide an API to
            <br/>
            access the log

            interface improvement, advertisement targeting etc.
            <br/>
            [00217] It will be further appreciated that in parallel, contacts coordinator
            <br/>
            240 may glean
            <br/>
            information from the data provided by the activity streams (messages) to build
            <br/>
            up a contact
            <br/>
            profile of the user in question. Data extractor 241 may extract data from
            <br/>
            activity messages and
            <br/>
            streams, data merger 243 may merge relevant data to a particular contact whose
            <br/>
            details may be
            <br/>
            stored and accessed from contacts database 245. Contact handler 242 may create
            <br/>
            new contacts,
            <br/>
            handle site user identity, anonymous users etc. and data and permissions
            <br/>
            handler 244 may
            <br/>
            handle the privacy protection and permissions of the relevant data. As

            discussed herein above
            <br/>
            data merger 243 may comprise a horizontal contact merger 277 and a vertical
            <br/>
            contact merger
            <br/>
            276. Horizontal contact merger 277 may merge two unrelated contacts due to a
            <br/>
            detected
            <br/>
            common primary ID and vertical contact merger 276 may merge an anonymous
            <br/>
            contact with a
            <br/>
            contact associated with a registered user upon login or registration which may

            <br/>
            Horizontal contact merger 277 may also comprise a virtual horizontal merger
            <br/>
            278 to maintain
            <br/>
            two contacts as separate but linking them together so they are marked as

            representing the same
            <br/>
            contact ¨ with or without merging the actual contact information. Vertical

            contact merger may
            <br/>
            276 also comprise a vertical virtual merger 279 to maintain an anonymous
            <br/>
            contact and a contact
            <br/>
            associated with a registered user as separate but may link them together so

            information. Data
            <br/>
            merger 243 may also merge contact information (typically extracted by data
            <br/>
            extractor 241) into
            <br/>
            an existing contact. It will be appreciated that contact identifier 272 may
            <br/>
            track user identities
            <br/>
            using cookies and may recognize contacts that should be merged as discussed in

            [00218] Referring back to Figs. 15, 16A and 16B, message passing may be
            <br/>
            performed on
            <br/>
            client 220, server 260 or both. It will be appreciated that third party
            <br/>
            applications 40 typically
            <br/>
            have a client side element and as well as a server side element, or at least a
            <br/>
            server side
            <br/>
            connection to the third party application 40 provider server 270. Hub 210 may
            <br/>
            process any
            <br/>
            messages between client 220 and third party applications 40 and hub 230
            <br/>
            between server 260
            <br/>
            and third party applications 40. It will be appreciated that data received by
            <br/>
            hub 210 may be
            <br/>
            processed and forwarded to hub 230 for further processing as described in more

            <br/>
            [00219] Reference is now made to Fig. 18 which illustrates a message passing
            <br/>
            scenario
            <br/>
            between different platforms. A user client machine X may be connected t
            <br/>
            website building
            <br/>
            system 30 on server Y. Website building system 30 may be implemented using a

            website
            <br/>
            building system 30 client component A' and a website building system 30 server

            applications 40 ¨ TPA1,
            <br/>
            TPA2 and ETPA3.
            <br/>
            [00220] TPA1 may be implemented with a client-side component D' and server
            <br/>
            side
            <br/>
            component D which connects with the TPA1 vendor server H. TPA2 may be
            <br/>
            implemented with
            <br/>
            a client-side component E' and server side component E which connects with the
            <br/>
            TPA2 vendor
            <br/>
            server I. ETPA3, however, may be a server-side-only third party application 40
            <br/>
            implemented by
            <br/>
            server side component G connected to a website building system 30 third party
            <br/>
            application 40
            <br/>
            support back-end F. The two may communicate with the third party application
            <br/>
            40 vendor
            <br/>
            server J.
            <br/>
            [00221] It will be appreciated that TPA1 and TPA2 may exchange messages on the
            <br/>
            client
            <br/>
            (between components D' and E'), on the server (between components D and E) or
            <br/>
            on both.
            <br/>
            However, any communication with ETPA3 must be done on the server only. It will
            <br/>
            be further
            <br/>
            appreciated that there are advantages and disadvantages to using either
            <br/>
            method. Client-side
            <br/>
            activity message sending may be more interactive and provides faster user
            <br/>
            response. Server-side
            <br/>
            activity message sending, may be more robust, more reliable (e.g. a user can't
            <br/>
            close the browser
            <br/>
            window in the middle of the process), provide better assurance of correct
            <br/>
            order of message
            <br/>
            reception and may also allow activity messages to be sent to back end third
            <br/>
            party applications 40
            <br/>
            installed on a backend or application dashboard. It will be appreciated that
            <br/>
            these back end third
            <br/>
            party applications 40 are not represented on the client side.
            <br/>
            [00222] An example of a case using multiple third party applications 40 is
            <br/>
            that of a user
            <br/>
            adding a product to a shopping cart in third party application A (the activity
            <br/>
            type is "cart
            <br/>
            change"). Third party application A may then send an activity message to
            <br/>
            website building
            <br/>
            system 30 with the added product. Website building system 30 may then forward
            <br/>
            the activity to
            <br/>
            all third party applications 40 registered to cart changes. Since third party
            <br/>
            application B is
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <br/>
            registered it receives the activity. Third party application B may then
            <br/>
            display a message to the
            <br/>
            user such as "If you also add product X, you will get a discount" or "Share
            <br/>
            this site to get a
            <br/>
            discount".
            <br/>
            [00223] Another example is a user "liking" (via Facebook for example)
            <br/>
            something in third
            <br/>
            party application A. Third party application A may then send an activity
            <br/>
            message to website
            <br/>
            building system 30 with activity type "Facebook like". Website building system
            <br/>
            30 may then
            <br/>
            forward the activity to all third party applications 40 registered to "like"
            <br/>
            activities. Since third
            <br/>
            party application B is registered it receives the activity. Third party
            <br/>
            application B may show a
            <br/>
            re-engagement widget to the user and display a message such as "If you like
            <br/>
            this site, how about
            <br/>
            contacting the site owner?" or "Do you want a discount coupon?"
            <br/>
            [00224] As discussed hereinabove, all communication may take place via hubs
            <br/>
            210 and 230.
            <br/>
            [00225] Router 211 may route the client side messages between the website and
            <br/>
            any third
            <br/>
            party applications 40. Router 211 may also route a message between hub 210 and
            <br/>
            hub 230 for
            <br/>
            further processing as described in more detail herein below.
            <br/>
            [00226] Router and tracker 231 may route messages between the website and any
            <br/>
            third party
            <br/>
            applications 40 and may also track messages. It will be appreciated that third
            <br/>
            party applications
            <br/>
            40 may also listen to messages on both the client and server. It will be
            <br/>
            further appreciated a third
            <br/>
            party application 40 may explicitly specify one or more activities to which it
            <br/>
            listens, e.g. listen
            <br/>
            to all "shopping cart ¨ add item" activities. The third party application 40
            <br/>
            may also specify
            <br/>
            activity classes to which it listens, e.g. listen to all Facebook related
            <br/>
            activities. Furthermore, the
            <br/>
            third party application may include a wild-card expression (applied to
            <br/>
            activity names) which is

            or not.
            <br/>
            [00227] It will also be appreciated that the third party application 40 may
            <br/>
            use an activity

            <br/>
            not normally available to the third party application itself, such as: user
            <br/>
            attributes (e.g. only
            <br/>
            registered users, only European users etc.), web site attributes or structure
            <br/>
            (e.g. only listen to a
            <br/>
            given activity on pages derived from a given page template), users history
            <br/>
            (e.g. only listen to
            <br/>
            cart checkout activity if the user made past purchases totaling over X) etc.
            <br/>
            Such a query may be
            <br/>
            specified by third party application 40, but may also be editable by the
            <br/>
            designer.
            <br/>
            [00228] Thus router and tracker 231 may also track the messages that are being
            <br/>
            listened to by
            <br/>
            third party application 40. It will be appreciated that such activity listener
            <br/>
            query architecture is
            <br/>
            best implemented at the activity routing level (instead of being performed by
            <br/>
            an API call inside
            <br/>
            third party application 40) since it may allow the web site designer to
            <br/>
            perform tailoring and
            <br/>
            customization, without requiring third party applications 40 to be highly
            <br/>
            programmable and
            <br/>
            customizable. Router and tracker 231 may also help in preserving user privacy,
            <br/>
            since the web
            <br/>
            site designer does not have to provide the additional information (required
            <br/>
            for the routing
            <br/>
            decision) to the third party applications 40 involved. It may also save
            <br/>
            unneeded invocations of
            <br/>
            communication with third party applications 40 which are often hosted on
            <br/>
            separate servers.
            <br/>
            [00229] It will be appreciated that it is the user (website visitor) that
            <br/>
            visits, registers and
            <br/>
            provides information to the website. The user may actually be unaware that the
            <br/>
            website he or
            <br/>
            she is accessing is built using a combination of website building system 30,
            <br/>
            components,
            <br/>
            constructed websites and third party applications 40. Thus, responsibility for
            <br/>
            user privacy
            <br/>
            ultimately lies with the website owner (who is also responsible for activities
            <br/>
            undertaken by the
            <br/>
            third party applications 40 included in his or her website).
            <br/>
            [00230] It will be further appreciated that user profile information may be
            <br/>
            accessed by third

            party applications 40 (and other website building system 30 components) based

            on privacy rules
            <br/>
            defined by the website building system 30 and through an API provided by

            otherwise).
            <br/>
            [00231] It will be appreciated that there may be three major privacy-related
            <br/>
            issues. The first is
            <br/>
            the interaction of the website and website building system 30 with the third
            <br/>
            party application 40
            <br/>
            provider. The website (and website building system 30) may not completely
            <br/>
            trust third party
            <br/>
            application 40 with its use of user data, e.g. that third party application 40
            <br/>
            will not mass-mail
            <br/>
            (using the sites' provided user e-mails), spam users who requested to be
            <br/>
            removed from mailing,
            <br/>
            or transfer user personal information to a 4th party. However, this can be
            <br/>
            resolved in the
            <br/>
            following ways:
            <br/>
            [00232] The website building system 30 vendor may require the third party
            <br/>
            application 40
            <br/>
            providers to sign a Terms of Use (ToU) agreement when adding them to the
            <br/>
            website building
            <br/>
            system 30 application market. Such an agreement may state that the third party
            <br/>
            application 40
            <br/>
            (and third party application 40 vendor) may not miss-use or further disclose
            <br/>
            the users'
            <br/>
            information. The website building system 30 vendor can then penalize the third
            <br/>
            party
            <br/>
            application provider if it mis-uses the information (e.g. disabling third
            <br/>
            party application 40,
            <br/>
            removing third party application 40 from the website building system 30
            <br/>
            application market
            <br/>
            etc.). Private policy enforcers 213 and 233 and private data proxy 234 may
            <br/>
            enforce the privacy
            <br/>
            policy on third party applications 40 as described in more detail herein
            <br/>
            below.
            <br/>
            [00233] The second privacy-related issue is the interaction of website and
            <br/>
            website building
            <br/>
            system 30 with the user (site visitor). The website must provide the user with
            <br/>
            a clear
            <br/>
            understanding of how his or her personal data may be used, receive agreement
            <br/>
            form the user and
            <br/>
            abide by the terms to which the user agreed. Website building system 30
            <br/>
            requires all published
            <br/>
            sites to provide the user with a ToU document which defines the allowed use of
            <br/>
            the private
            <br/>
            information belonging to the user, and the user is required to electronically
            <br/>
            sign that document.

            <br/>
            The site must then abide by these terms and allowed use. Website building
            <br/>
            system 30 may also
            <br/>
            include a sample ToU page in each website template it provides. Private policy

            enforcers 213
            <br/>
            and 233 may ensure that the terms of use of the ToU document are kept. Private
            <br/>
            policy
            <br/>
            enforcers 213 and 233 may also ensure that only allowed information is
            <br/>
            provided to the TPA by
            <br/>
            deleting or rearranging the relevant data.
            <br/>
            [00234] The third privacy-related issue is the support of unsubscribe
            <br/>
            requests. The site must
            <br/>
            provide the user with an option to unsubscribe from any marketing e-mails.
            <br/>
            These may be
            <br/>
            handled by data and permissions handler 244 described in more detail herein
            <br/>
            below.
            <br/>
            [00235] Data and permissions handler 244 may also handle the different user
            <br/>
            permissions set
            <br/>
            by different users as described in more detail herein below.
            <br/>
            [00236] Private data proxy 234 may allow website building system 30 (and the
            <br/>
            web sites built
            <br/>
            in it) to keep all or some private data in a secure repository managed by

            <br/>
            (instead of the
            <br/>
            private data) which can be used by the website building system 30 to retrieve
            <br/>
            the hidden private
            <br/>
            data. For example ¨ an e-mail address is replaced with an alternate "e-mail
            <br/>
            address ID"
            <br/>
            provided to the third party application 40, so that third party application 40
            <br/>
            cannot access the
            <br/>
            actual e-mail address.
            <br/>
            [00237] Private data proxy 234 may also provide a set of interfaces for
            <br/>
            various
            <br/>
            communication methods (e.g. e-mail, social network messaging etc.) which may
            <br/>
            be used by
            <br/>
            third party application 40 to contact / send messages to the user without
            <br/>
            third party application
            <br/>
            40 actually accessing private data associated with the user. Such private data
            <br/>
            may include all
            <br/>
            identifying details through which a user may be contacted, including (for
            <br/>
            example): name,
            <br/>
            address, e-mail, phone (including SMS/MMS), unified communication ID (Skype
            <br/>
            etc.) and

            enforce user unsubscribe requests and throttle user message sending, e.g.

            [00239] For third party applications 40 hosted on website building system 30

            modified information to any specific third party application 40. This could

            be, for example, due
            <br/>
            to general security concerns, specific privacy commitments regarding any

            the message is not further transmitted.

            211). Third party
            <br/>
            application B may then receive the message and validate the signature. If the

            current validation
            <br/>
            fails, the message is reported as invalid and not further processed. It will
            <br/>
            be appreciated that
            <br/>
            validator and signer 235 may only perform server side and not client side
            <br/>
            processing to ensure

            [00248] As discussed herein above, system 200 may employ multiple types of

            communication
            <br/>
            between website building system 30 and third party applications 40. These may
            <br/>
            include, for
            <br/>
            example control communication, e.g. website building system 30 commanding the
            <br/>
            third party
            <br/>
            application 40 to shut down, functional communication, e.g. a shopping cart

            third party
            <br/>
            application 40 sending the total purchase amount through website building

            communication which is
            <br/>
            the example discussed in this application. It will be appreciated that these
            <br/>
            different types of
            <br/>
            communication have different profiles and requirements, e.g. in terms of
            <br/>
            amount of messages
            <br/>
            sent, priority, robustness, response time requirements etc.

            <br/>
            [00249] In particular, system 200 may include activity reports which are very
            <br/>
            frequent (e.g. if
            <br/>
            third party application 40 graphical user interface (GUI) events are made into
            <br/>
            reported third
            <br/>
            party application 40 activities). Such numerous activity reports may overwhelm
            <br/>
            the parts of the
            <br/>
            system handling more critical messages. Therefore system 200 may implement
            <br/>
            multiple
            <br/>
            communication channels (e.g. using different ports, multiple concurrent
            <br/>
            sessions etc.) so that
            <br/>
            each class of messages is sent via a separate channel. This way, activity
            <br/>
            reporting uses a side
            <br/>
            channel, and is parallel to and does not interfere with command and functional
            <br/>
            communication.
            <br/>
            [00250] As discussed herein above, system 200 may gather activity information
            <br/>
            in order to
            <br/>
            create and enhance contact information via contacts coordinator 240 and
            <br/>
            activity coordinator
            <br/>
            250 as well as collate activity events associated with a particular contact.
            <br/>
            For each activity

            message that is routed through hubs 210 and 230, contacts coordinator 240 and
            <br/>
            activity
            <br/>
            coordinator 250 may process the information. Stream creator 251 may create
            <br/>
            contact specific
            <br/>
            data streams from the activity messages and the elements of contacts
            <br/>
            coordinator 240 may
            <br/>
            extract the data and process it before storing it on contacts database 245.
            <br/>
            [00251] Therefore each activity stream may have a constructed contact
            <br/>
            associated with it
            <br/>
            which may gradually be enhanced with data extracted from the activities
            <br/>
            performed under the
            <br/>
            data stream. It will be appreciated that contacts coordinator 240 may also
            <br/>
            recognize the
            <br/>
            existence of related contacts - multiple contact records which are found to
            <br/>
            describe the same
            <br/>
            person. Contact identifier 272 may recognize such records by matching a
            <br/>
            primary ID field, such
            <br/>
            as e-mail, phone number, social security number, Facebook ID etc. It will be
            <br/>
            appreciated that
            <br/>
            some primary ID fields are multi-value fields (e.g., a person can have
            <br/>
            multiple identifying e-
            <br/>
            mails), whereas some are strictly single-value fields (e.g., a social security
            <br/>
            number).
            <br/>
            [00252] Therefore data merger 243 may merge contact fields extracted from a
            <br/>
            new activity
            <br/>
            into the current constructed contact and may merge a constructed contact

            anonymous user has performed a login operation and has become an identified
            <br/>
            user (this may be
            <br/>
            known as "vertical" merging). Horizontal contact merger 277 may also perform
            <br/>
            "horizontal"
            <br/>
            merging of two different contacts (constructed contact or stored contacts)

            when it detects that
            <br/>
            these are related contacts which refer to the same user. As discussed herein
            <br/>
            above, such merging
            <br/>
            may by actual merging (i.e. converting two separate contacts into a single
            <br/>
            contact), merging one
            <br/>
            contact into the other or performed through virtual merging (i.e. maintaining
            <br/>
            the two contacts as
            <br/>
            separate ones but linking them together so they are marked as representing the
            <br/>
            same user ¨ with
            <br/>
            or without merging the actual contact information and activity streams). It
            <br/>
            will also be
            <br/>
            appreciated that even in virtual merging further added information may be
            <br/>
            added to the multiple
            <br/>
            linked virtually-merged contacts.
            <br/>
            [00253] Thus, data extractor 241 may extract contact-type information from the
            <br/>
            pertinent data
            <br/>
            activity structure and data merger 243 may integrate the contact-type
            <br/>
            information into the
            <br/>
            contact associated with the activity streams (anonymous or identified). If the
            <br/>
            contact-type
            <br/>
            information I contains a primary ID field, data merger 243 may check for
            <br/>
            related contacts based
            <br/>
            on the primary ID field value and if found, merge these contacts. Data merger
            <br/>
            243 may also
            <br/>
            check if the activity establishes the users' identity in the site (e.g. a site
            <br/>
            login activity) and if so,
            <br/>
            merge the anonymous contact with the existing contact record stored for the
            <br/>
            user, and make it
            <br/>
            an identified contact from now on.
            <br/>
            [00254] It will be appreciated that contact identifier 272 may implement
            <br/>
            multiple methods to
            <br/>
            identify the site users, such as by using a cookie to track a session by a
            <br/>
            single anonymous user
            <br/>
            (which did not login into the site), using site login for registered users,

            through a social login for

            site users whose account is associated with a social network or by matching

            primary ID fields
            <br/>
            (such as email / phone) to identify that two user profiles describe the same

            form (displayed by some third party application 40) under the name of John

            by a 2nd person using
            <br/>

            <br/>
            preserve his or her
            <br/>
            privacy. The same may apply when data merger 243 merges multiple anonymous

            [00285] Contradiction resolver 264 may typically handle contradictions

            most fields (including primary key fields such as e-mail and phone) are list

            contain multiple values. This may apply only to multiple uses of the same

            such contradiction which cannot be resolved (e.g. by merging the multiple
            <br/>
            values into a list

            value) may be flagged for possible manual handling by the site owner, by the

            end-user (which

            may determine which value to use) or using other techniques.
            <br/>
            [00286] Thus, it is possible that the constructed contact information may

            [00289] Data merger 243 may normalize the primary key values and create a

            The following
            <br/>
            discussion refers to e-mails; however, the discussion and technology applies
            <br/>
            to any type of

            information used to contact the user as noted above (phone, fax, Skype ID,

            <br/>
            [00302] For example, the way in which an e-mail address was provided to the
            <br/>
            site may
            <br/>
            indicate different permissions for its use. Some possible sources for e-mail
            <br/>
            addresses are,
            <br/>
            registration ID; contact form, newsletter sign-up and an unsubscribe request.
            <br/>
            The e-mail
            <br/>
            addresses may further differ in terms of the "allowed use agreement"
            <br/>
            electronically signed by
            <br/>
            the user.
            <br/>
            [00303] It will be appreciated thatwebsite building system 30 typically has
            <br/>
            information
            <br/>
            concerning the allowed uses for a given e-mail. However, the website owner may
            <br/>
            have different,
            <br/>
            separate or additional information. For example due to the nature of the
            <br/>
            different sign-up forms
            <br/>
            in the site or due to having contacts in the system imported by the website
            <br/>
            from a different
            <br/>
            source which includes additional usage permissions information.
            <br/>
            [00304] Data and permissions handler 244 may enforce the right use policy on
            <br/>
            third party
            <br/>
            applications 40 used in the site in order to assist the website owner in
            <br/>
            managing this
            <br/>
            information.
            <br/>
            [00305] Therefore the contact record for the pertinent contact may include two
            <br/>
            fields of
            <br/>
            information. The first field is the website permissions field containing
            <br/>
            derived or suggested
            <br/>
            permissions calculated by the website from the user activity. A contact form
            <br/>
            implies functional
            <br/>
            emails only whereas a subscribe form may implies recurring emails. The second
            <br/>
            field is a site
            <br/>
            owner permissions field based on the website permissions field value. The site
            <br/>
            owner may
            <br/>
            change the website recommendations and do whatever he or she likes, but he or
            <br/>
            she are
            <br/>
            responsible for any use which exceeds the permissions defined by the website
            <br/>
            permissions field.
            <br/>
            [00306] It will be appreciated that the website permissions field value
            <br/>
            represents the best
            <br/>
            knowledge of the website of the intention of the users. The site owner
            <br/>
            permissions value is the
            <br/>
            one assigned by the website and used by third party application 40 and other
            <br/>
            parts of the system
            <br/>
            (e.g. by a third party application 40 providing newsletter sending).

            <br/>
            requires explicit subscription / approval, and may include detailed

            <br/>
            [00314] It will be appreciated that data and permissions handler 244 may use
            <br/>
            alternate
            <br/>
            methods, such as a permission bit-mask (similar to the one used on UNIX and

            Linux systems)
            <br/>
            or ACL (Access Control List) mechanism. Data and permissions handler 244 may
            <br/>
            also
            <br/>
            implement separate permissions fields for separate parts of the contact
            <br/>
            information (e.g. e-mail,
            <br/>

            <br/>
            [00315] A typical use scenario is one in which contacts database 245 contains
            <br/>
            a first set of e-
            <br/>
            mails gathered from contact forms and second set of e-mails from subscription
            <br/>
            requests. The
            <br/>
            website may call a newsletter sending third party application 40 , knowing
            <br/>
            that the third party
            <br/>
            applications 40 would send e-mails only to users belonging to the 2nd set of
            <br/>
            users (the one who
            <br/>
            sent subscription requests).
            <br/>
            [00316] The advantages of such a system include better protection (both
            <br/>
            technical and legal) ¨
            <br/>
            for both the website and the website owner ¨ from accidental spamming of the
            <br/>
            users or private
            <br/>
            information misuse as well as the capability to actually enforce privacy
            <br/>
            policy when used in
            <br/>
            conjunction with private data proxy 234 as described herein above. It may also
            <br/>
            ensure that
            <br/>
            unsubscribe requests are more strictly enforced.
            <br/>
            [00317] Therefore a user may generate a stream of activities between the
            <br/>
            pertinent website
            <br/>
            building system 30 and any related third party applications 40. These streams
            <br/>
            may be known as
            <br/>
            activity streams. Each activity stream may be used as an information source
            <br/>
            for a single contact.
            <br/>
            The activity data structure of individual streams may also be merged to form
            <br/>
            the contact if it
            <br/>
            may be determined that the different activity streams come from the same
            <br/>
            source. For example,
            <br/>
            a single user may work anonymously through two devices such as a mobile device
            <br/>
            and a
            <br/>
            personal computer. Such a user may create two anonymous streams under which a
            <br/>
            message may
            <br/>
            be stored. Once the streams have been identified as being associated with the
            <br/>
            same user, they
            <br/>
            may be merged.
