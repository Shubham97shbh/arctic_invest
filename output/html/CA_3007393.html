            Background
            <br/>
            [0003] The productivity of bees can be very sensitive to such things as
            <br/>
            viruses, stress, etc. This
            <br/>
            can show itself in many ways, such as, for example, amount of honey produced
            <br/>
            per a particular
            <br/>
            bee hive. Accordingly, there is a constant search in this area for ways to
            <br/>
            address these issues.

            pollen collection, or
            <br/>
            both.
            <br/>
            [0051] The inventors have found that administering to bees at or near a bee
            <br/>
            hive said veterinary
            <br/>
            composition enhances bees performance, e.g. as demonstrated by increased honey
            <br/>
            production,
            <br/>
            increased number of brood cells, larger bees, and accelerated movement of bees
            <br/>
            out of the hive
            <br/>
            and into it. Without wishing to be limited to a theory, such enhanced
            <br/>
            performance may result
            <br/>
            from direct effects on the bees, e.g.: increasing their need for sugars, which
            <br/>
            leads to increasing
            <br/>
            nectar collection activity; improving their health, improving their immune
            <br/>
            system and/or
            <br/>
            reducing their stress, which provides for better protection from pathogens;
            <br/>
            increasing the amount
            <br/>
            of laid eggs, which adds brood cells and increases thereby the need for pollen
            <br/>
            collection; etc.
            <br/>
            Alternatively or additionally, such enhanced performance may result from
            <br/>
            direct effects on bees
            <br/>
            pathogens, e.g. viruses, Varroa. Nosema, bacteria associated with brood
            <br/>
            diseases, etc. According
            <br/>
            to this alternative, administering said veterinary composition to the bees
            <br/>
            could also be
            <br/>
            understood to include administering it to bees pathogens.

            [0089] The inventors have found that administering to bees at or near a bee
            <br/>
            hive said veterinary
            <br/>
            second composition enhances bees performance, e.g. as demonstrated by
            <br/>
            increased honey
            <br/>
            production, increased number of brood cells, larger bees, and accelerated
            <br/>
            movement of bees out
            <br/>
            of the hive and into it. Without wishing to be limited to a theory, such
            <br/>
            enhanced performance
            <br/>
            may result from direct effects on the bees, e.g.: increasing their need for
            <br/>
            sugars, which leads to
            <br/>
            increasing nectar collection activity; improving their health, improving their
            <br/>
            immune system
            <br/>
            and/or reducing their stress, which provides for better protection from
            <br/>
            pathogens; increasing the
            <br/>
            number of laid eggs, which adds brood cells and increases thereby the need for
            <br/>
            pollen collection;
            <br/>
            etc. Alternatively or additionally, such enhanced performance may result from
            <br/>
            direct effects on
            <br/>
            bees pathogens, e.g. viruses, Varroa. Nosema, bacteria associated with brood
            <br/>
            diseases, etc.
            <br/>
            According to this alternative, administering said veterinary second
            <br/>
            composition to the bees could
            <br/>
            result in administering the composition to bees pathogens.

            Examples
            <br/>
            Example 1: Preparing cannabis extracts
            <br/>
            [0106] Buds of two strains were dried at ambient temperature and at controlled
            <br/>
            moisture. The
            <br/>
            dried buds were then ground and mixed well for homogenization. Moisture
            <br/>
            content was
            <br/>
            11.2%wt. The dried and ground plant material was extracted by mixing with 95%
            <br/>
            ethanol
            <br/>
            solution at 10 milliliter (m1) ethanol solution per 1 gram of plant material.
            <br/>
            Mixing was conducted
            <br/>
            at ambient temperature for 30 minutes. Then the plant material was filtered
            <br/>
            out and the solution
            <br/>
            was evaporated at sub-atmospheric pressure for removing the majority of the
            <br/>
            ethanol. The
            <br/>
            remaining solution was kept in a freezer for at least 24hours, followed by
            <br/>
            filtering out waxes.
            <br/>
            The de-waxed solution was further evaporated for removing the rest of the
            <br/>
            ethanol. The residual
            <br/>
            solution was then kept at a temperature of 120 C until bubbling stopped to
            <br/>
            form the
            <br/>
            decarboxylated extract. Samples of the extracts were analyzed for their
            <br/>
            cannabinoids content.

            Comparative method:
            <br/>
            [0108] Several trials were made to form homogeneous mixtures where said 55%
            <br/>
            sucrose solution
            <br/>
            forms a carrier to deliver the extracts of Example 1. The weight/weight ratios
            <br/>
            between the
            <br/>
            extracts and the 55% sucrose solutions were selected to reach cannabinoids
            <br/>
            concentration in the
            <br/>
            mixture in the range between 2Oppm and 1000ppm. No homogeneous solution was
            <br/>
            formed. At
            <br/>
            least a fraction of the extract remained undissolved and tended to stick to
            <br/>
            the walls of the sugar
            <br/>
            container.
            <br/>
            Working method:
            <br/>
            [0109] The extract was mixed with honey to form extract-honey mixtures and
            <br/>
            those extract-
            <br/>
            honey mixtures were mixed with the 55% sucrose solution. Thus, 30-50 grams
            <br/>
            honey as such or
            <br/>
            after dilution with 10% water, 20% water or 30% water, was warmed to 45 C.
            <br/>
            Then the extract
            <br/>
            was gradually added, while thoroughly mixing. Mixing was continued for 30
            <br/>
            minutes after the
            <br/>
            addition is completed, whereby extract-honey mixtures were formed. The 55%
            <br/>
            sucrose solution
            <br/>
            was gradually added to the extract-honey mixtures until the desired overall
            <br/>
            cannabinoid
            <br/>
            concentration was reached. The weight/weight ratio between honey and the
            <br/>
            sucrose solution
            <br/>
            were in the range between 1:10 and 1:1000. At all tested cannabinoid
            <br/>
            concentrations, up to
            <br/>
            several thousand parts per million, the formed final solutions were
            <br/>
            homogeneous.

            composition, the
            <br/>
            weight/weight ratio between honey and the sucrose solution was 1:20. Three
